00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.730
In 2022, humanity finally...

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.690
created a complete virtual environment.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.370
It's time for this week's episode of MMO Stream!

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.400
Earlier, we showed you a promotional video.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.080
Could this be from last week's launch day?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.810
End of Line
Could this be from last week's launch day?

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.040
What were all these people waiting in line for?
End of Line

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.910
That's right, Sword Art Online!

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920

On today's MMO Stream, we'll be covering the
world-famous Sword Art Online, or SAO for short!

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.680
Truth be told, none of the NerveGear software so far
have really taken advantage of the hardware.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.200
Onii-chan.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.320
Yeah! There, I said it!
Onii-chan.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.240
I'm heading out for club activities.
Yeah! There, I said it!

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.940
But SAO was produced by Kayaba Akihiko, who also invented the NerveGear.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.060
What's more, it's going to be the best Virtual MMORPG ever!

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.250
Every beta tester said it was incredible.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.870
I wanted a copy too!

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.460
Only 10,000 copies were available in the first round.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.260
It completely sold out online in seconds.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.420
And as you saw in the footage earlier,
hardcore fans bought all the store copies—

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.810
Link Start!

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.390
I've finally returned...

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.740
...to this world!

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.880
1st Floor • Town of Beginnings
1st Floor • Town of Beginnings

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.630
So like, we really oughta...

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.070
Hey, let's form a party.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.240
Gee, I dunno...

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.470
Come on, it'll be fun!

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.680
Hey!

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.350
You there!

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.000
Me?

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.420
You move like you've been here before.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.150
You were in the beta test, right?

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.560
Y-Yeah.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.180
This is my first day here.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.670
Show me the ropes, okay?

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.830
U-Uh...

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.730
I'm begging you!

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.750
I'm Klein. Nice to meet you.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.920
I'm Kirito.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.430

1st Floor • Town of Beginnings, West Field
1st Floor • Town of Beginnings, West Field

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.550
Right in the crotch...

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.760
You're overreacting.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.540
You shouldn't feel any pain.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.810
Oh, yeah.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.020
Just a habit, I guess.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.510
I told you.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.110
What's important is your initial motion input.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.770
Sure, I get that...

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.130
But it keeps moving around.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.870
If you start the motion correctly and activate a sword skill,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.960
the system will ensure that the technique connects.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.130
Motion... Motion...

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.680
How should I put it?

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.660
Just build up the attack for a bit,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.180
and when you feel the skill begin to activate, let it explode.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.660
Explode?

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.960
All right!

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.630
Congrats.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.630
However...

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.870
That boar would be equivalent to, say, slimes in another game.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.700
Huh, seriously?!

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.060
I thought it was a mid-level boss or something.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.730
Of course not.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.920
Addictive, isn't it?

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.150
Yeah!

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.620
There are lots of skills, right?

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.660
Like blacksmithing and stuff?

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.160
Yeah.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.950
I hear there's an unlimited number of skills.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.170
On the other hand, there's no magic.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.030
An RPG without magic?

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.670
That's a bold decision.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.090
Isn't it more fun to actually move your body when fighting?

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.300
Absolutely!

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.550
Okay, next one.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.760
Yeah, let's keep it going!

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.200
No matter how much I stare at all this, I still can't believe we're in a game.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.870
The guy who made it is a genius.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.110
It's amazing.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.020
I'm so glad I was born in this era.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.710
You make a big deal out of everything.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.650
It's my first Full Dive!

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.170
Is this your first time playing a NerveGear game, then?

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.850
It's more like I rushed out and
bought the hardware just to play SAO.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.640
I was really lucky to get one of
the ten thousand first-press copies.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.610
But hey, you got into the beta test,
which makes you ten times luckier.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.070
Only a thousand people had that chance.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.940
I guess so.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.550
So, how far did you make it in the beta?

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.400
I only managed to get to the 8th floor in the two months.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.160
One month should be more than enough this time, though.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.370
You're really into this.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.550
Truth be told, during the beta testing period,

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.510
SAO was all I thought about, day and night.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.130
You can go anywhere you want
in this world with a single blade.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:08.330
This may be a virtual world, but I feel
more alive here than I do in the real world.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.110
Well, want to hunt some more?

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.560
Of course!

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.070
I'd love to...

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.940
...but I'm starving.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.280
I'm logging out.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.930
Eating food in this world only tricks you into thinking you're not hungry.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.620
I've already ordered some hot pizza to arrive at 5:30pm.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.990
You're well-prepared.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.930
Yup!

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.460
Well, I'll log right back in after I'm done eating.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.920
I see.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.920
Hey.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.170
I'm meeting up later with some people I got to know from another game.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.390
How about friending them too?

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.540
If you don't want to, that's okay.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.850
I'll introduce you some other time.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.620
Yeah, sorry.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.570
Thanks.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.920
Nah, I'm the one who's thankful.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.720
I'll repay you for all this sometime.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.370
Mentally.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.500
Thanks so much, man.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.800
I'll see you around.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.170
If you have any other questions, just let me know.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.630
Yeah, I'll do that!

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.250
Huh?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.850
There's no logout button.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.450
Look closer.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.460
I still can't find it.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.310
It's at the bottom of the main menu...

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.930
See? It's not there.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.610
No, it isn't.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.750
Well, it's the first day out of beta.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.300
There are bound to be some bugs.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.680
I'm sure the server people are freaking out.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.610
You'll freak out in a bit too.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.330
It's 5:25pm.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.130
My teriyaki and mayo pizza and ginger ale!

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.800
Just hurry up and give a Game Master a call.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.930
I've already tried that, but nothing's happening.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.260
Is there any other way to log out?

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.340
No.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.230
A player has to go through the menu to log themselves out.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.940
That's ridiculous.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.600
There's gotta be some way.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.630
Return!

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.620
Log out!

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.860
Break out!

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.320
I told you.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.910
There wasn't an emergency logout method in the manual either.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.540
Hey, you're kidding, right?

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.790
I know. I'll just rip the NerveGear off my head.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.970
You can't.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.530
We can't move our real bodies.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:54.730
The NerveGear intercepts every signal
your brain sends to your body right here.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.450
Seriously?

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.230
So we have no choice but to wait for them to fix the bug?

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:06.960
Or for someone in the real world to
remove the NerveGear from our heads.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.080
I live by myself, though.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.700
What about you?

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.520
I live with my mom and younger sister,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.160
so I think they'll notice by dinnertime...

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.620
H-How old is your sister?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.680
Sh-She's in a sports club, and she hates games.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.580
She has nothing in common with people like us—

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.670
Who cares—

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.730
Oh right, it doesn't hurt.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.530
That aside, don't you find this weird?

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.090
Sure I do.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.060
It's a bug.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.270
It's more than just a bug.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:44.410
The inability to log out will have serious repercussions on the game's future.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.990
You're right, now that you mention it.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:53.890
They could just shut down the server and log everyone out in situations like this.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.870
But there hasn't even been an announcement...

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.220
What's happening?

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.190
I don't know.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.410
A forced teleport?

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.620
Up there.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.590
That's...

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.520
What's that?

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.010
A Game Master?

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.070
Why doesn't he have a face?

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.320
Is this an event?

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.670
I'm scared...

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.790
Don't worry.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.790
It's just part of the opening ceremony.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.540
Players, welcome to my world.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.290
"My world"?

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.170
I am Kayaba Akihiko.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.260
I am currently the only person who can control this world.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.180
<b>Kayaba     Akihiko
Project Director
« Sword Art • Online »</b>

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.820
Is that really him?

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.440
He must've spent a lot of time on this.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:46.610
I trust that you have already noticed the
logout button is missing from the main menu.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.180
However, this is not a game malfunction.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.690
I repeat.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:56.700
This is not a game malfunction, but
an original feature of Sword Art Online.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.330
A-A feature?

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.120
You cannot log out of SAO on your own.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:08.080
No one on the outside will be able to
shut down or remove the NerveGear.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.920
Should this be attempted,

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.370
the transmitter inside the NerveGear will
emit a powerful burst of microwave radiation,

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.890
destroying your brain and thus ending your life.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.300
What?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.970
Come on, enough already.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.130
Let's go.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.690
Hey, I can't leave!

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.410
What's he talking about?

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.280
He's gotta be nuts.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.400
Right, Kirito?

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.070
He's right. The transceiver's microwave signals are just like those in a microwave oven.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.700
If the limiter were disabled, it could fry our brains.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.240
Why don't we just cut the power, then?

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.260
No, the NerveGear has an internal battery.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.890
That's just messed up!

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.130
What's going on?!

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:56.950
Unfortunately, the friends and family members of several players have ignored this warning

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.450
and attempted to remove the NerveGear.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:09.630
As a result, 213 players have permanently
retired in both Aincrad and the real world.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.390
213 players?

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.710
I don't believe it...

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.070
I don't believe it at all!

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:21.530
As you can see, news organizations across the world are reporting on this incident and the many deaths.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:28.500
Deaths caused by online game continue to rise
<b>More Victims in Nagoya
Thus, you can now assume the danger of having your NerveGear removed to be greatly reduced.</b>

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.500
Please relax and work hard to clear the game.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.250
However, do take note of this.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.250
You can no longer respawn in this game.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:46.320
Once your HP reaches zero,
your avatar will be permanently erased.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.270
At the same time...

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:53.040
...the NerveGear will destroy your brain.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.600
You need only fulfill one condition to set yourselves free—

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.210
clear the game.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:19.300
You are currently on the 1st floor, the lowest level of Aincrad.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:24.560
Make your way through each dungeon and defeat
the Floor Boss, and you will advance to the next level.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.560
Defeat the final boss on the
100th floor, and you will clear the game.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.480
Clear?

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.060
What's he talking about?

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.520
E-Easier said than done!

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.530
Clear a hundred floors?

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.460
That's impossible.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.130
The beta testers never made it anywhere near that far!

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.450
And finally,

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:48.950
you can find a gift from me in your item storage.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.820
Please check for yourselves.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.850
Mirror

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.040
A mirror?
Mirror

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.700
Klein?!

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.860
You okay, Kirito?

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.170
Y-Yeah...

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.570
Who are you?

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.140
And who are you?

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.840
You're a guy?!

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.120
You were lying about being seventeen?!

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.120
Which means...

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.140
You're Kirito?!
You're Klein?!

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.950
How?

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:35.630
That scan...

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:40.720
The NerveGear traces your entire face with its high-density sensor.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.330
That's how it knows what your face looks like.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.090
But what about our height and body shape?

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:49.670
When we first used the NerveGear, we had to calibrate it.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.270
Remember? You had to touch your body all over.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.940
I-I see. That must be how it got the data.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.250
But... But...

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.600
Seriously, why?

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.900
Why is this happening?

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.870
I'm sure he'll tell us soon enough.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.300
All of you must be wondering why.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:16.020
Why would Kayaba Akihiko, the creator of
Sword Art Online and the NerveGear, do all this?

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.650
My goal has already been achieved.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.950
I wanted to create my own world that I could observe and admire.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.070
That is why I made Sword Art Online.

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.260
Kayaba...

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.270
And now, it has all been fulfilled.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:40.520
This ends the tutorial for the official Sword Art Online launch.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.490
I wish every player the best of luck.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.840
This is reality.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.360
Kayaba Akihiko, the genius who created
the NerveGear and a complete virtual environment.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.330
I admired him, so I get it.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.290
<b>Kayaba     Akihiko

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.790
<b>『Sword Art Online』 Programmer Kayaba Akihiko
This is a game, but it's not just something you play.
What he said was the truth.</b>

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.040
If I die in this world...

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.250
I'll die for real.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.460
No...

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.510
No!

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.760
Screw you!

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.760
Let me out! Let me out of here!

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.610
I can't stay here! I'm meeting up with someone after this!

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:56.470
What's your problem?!

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.390
Let us out!

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.720
Tell us it's a lie!

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.550
Somebody!

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.610
Somebody do something!

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.580
Come with me, Klein.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:12.990
Listen to me.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.250
I'm heading to the next village right now.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.620
Come with me.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:24.540
If what he said is true, then we must train ourselves up as much as possible in order to survive in this world.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:32.840
The resources within a Virtual MMORPG,
the money and EXP we can earn, are limited.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.060
The fields surrounding the
Town of Beginnings will soon be picked clean.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.560
For efficiency's sake, we should head to
the next village now and set up camp there.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.070
I know the way and all the dangerous areas.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.360
We can get there safely even at Level 1.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.650
But... But you know...

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:56.720
My gaming friends and I spent days in line to buy and play this.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.290
They're in the plaza somewhere.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.710
I can't leave them behind.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.050
If it were just Klein...

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.660
But two more...

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.490
Or even one more...

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.840
Sorry.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.610
I really shouldn't be asking you for anything more.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.050
So don't worry about me and just go to the next village.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.120
I used to lead a guild in my last game.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.530
I'll get by somehow with the stuff you taught me.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.080
All right.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.750
We'll part here, then.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.990
Send me a message if anything happens.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.750
Will do.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.210
Well, see you, Klein.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:43.960
Kirito!

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.380
Hey.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.060
Kirito.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.760
You actually have a pretty cute face.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.850
I like it a lot.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.730
And that unkempt face of yours suits you ten times better.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.850
I... I...

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:43.890
I'll definitely survive...

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.340
...in this world!
