WEBVTT

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.330
Asuna.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.290
You're late, Kirito-kun.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.870
You...

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.130
What if I ended up catching a cold?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.550
S-Sugou?

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.010
That was quite cruel of you, Kirito-kun.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.380
I can still feel the pain.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.350
Sugou, you've already lost.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.430
Just wait to be judged by the law.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.060
Lost? What do you mean?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.890
There are countless corporations that would take me.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.190
Yes, once my research is complete,
I can become a true king...

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.570
The god of this world.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.320
You...

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.110
But before that...

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.280
I'll have to kill you, Kirito-kun.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.580
Hey, stand up.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.580
On your feet already!

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.680
A piece of trash like you... getting in my...

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.140
Getting in my way!

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.390
The punishment for such a sin is, of course, death.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.730
Anything less would be unthinkable!

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.400
Huh?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.620
The vision in my right eye is blurry, so I missed.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.000
You garbage...

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.500
You...

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.210
A brat like you... doesn't have any <i>real</i> power, get it?!

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.130
<i>Sugou,</i>

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.010
<i>you're no different, are you?</i>

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.470
Die, you damn brat!

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.570
What a feeble weapon.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.490
It's light, and doesn't have much reach.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.070
But it's more than enough to kill you with!

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.810
<i>Come on. She's waiting.</i>

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.380
Asuna.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.800
Kirito-kun.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.230
Yeah.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.190
The final...

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.570
The true final battle just ended.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.990
It's over.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.830
Sorry. I still can't hear properly.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.920
But I can tell what you're saying.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.840
It's over, isn't it?

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.590
Finally... I finally got to meet you.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.060
It's nice to meet you.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.310
I'm Yuuki Asuna.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.770
I'm back, Kirito-kun.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.110
I'm Kirigaya Kazuto.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.610
Welcome back, Asuna.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.460
And so, this sentence structure is...

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.250
Well, that's all for today.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.420
I'll send out assignments #25 and #26,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.840
so be sure to upload them by next week.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.780
Sorry for the wait, Asuna.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.490
I'm beat.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.240
And hungry.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.120
You sound like an old man, Kirito-kun.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.960
To be honest, I feel like I've aged
five years over the past month.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.090
Also, it's not Kirito, but Kazuto.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.340
It's bad etiquette to use
character names here, after all.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.470
Oh, right! I just...

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.430
Wait. What about me, then?

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.600
It's obvious!

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.520
That's what you get for using your
real name as your character name.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.650
Well, everyone that attends this school
is a victim of the SAO incident,

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.530
so it looks like I can't hide it, either.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.740
Asuna,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.910
how have you been feeling lately?

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.240
You're still in rehab, right?

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.000
Yeah, I can finally walk around without a cane.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.960
But they told me that I shouldn't run or anything yet.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.250
I see.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.050
By the way, Kirito-kun...

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.590
Don't you know?

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.300
This spot is in plain view from the cafeteria.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.890
Honestly...

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.270
There's no lunch for Mr. Careless!

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.270
Oh, please forgive me.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.480
Ta-dah!

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.740
By the way, is your father doing well?

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.410
Yeah, he was pretty dejected for a while though.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.330
He resigned as CEO and is basically retired,

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.750
so it seems like he's unsure of what to do now.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.420
Now, if he picks up a hobby or
two, I'm sure he'll cheer up.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.970
I see.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.970
<i>On that snowy day, Sugou was
arrested in the hospital parking lot.</i>

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.180
<i>After his arrest, he denied charges,</i>

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.150
<i>and tried to place all the blame on Kayaba Akihiko.</i>

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.900
<i>But once one of his employees was brought in to testify,</i>

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.070
<i>he quickly confessed to everything.</i>

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.490
<i>Fortunately, the 300 players who were victimized</i>

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.700
<i>had no recollection of being experimented on.</i>

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.870
<i>None of them developed any
mental or personality disorders,</i>

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.080
<i>and apparently, they'll all be able to return to society.</i>

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.630
<i>However,</i>

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.420
<i>games of the Virtual MMO genre</i>

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.550
<i>suffered a fatal blow.</i>

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.010
<i>In the end, RCT progress dissolved.</i>

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.020
<i>And RCT itself didn't come out unscathed, either.</i>

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.270
<i>Of course, ALO was forced to discontinue service,</i>

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:58.780
<i>and five or six other Virtual MMO
games were expected to follow suit.</i>

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.780
Say, come to think of it, what
became of the Commander?

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.960
Kayaba... is dead.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.500
Apparently, it was suicide.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.750
Suicide?

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.250
It seems that, at the time of the SAO world's collapse,

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.460
he ran a high-output scan on his own brain.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.550
Does that mean he copied his
consciousness onto the Internet?

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.470
I heard that his chances of success
weren't even one in a thousand.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.470
However...

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.150
Back then, I definitely spoke
with Kayaba's consciousness.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.520
<i>What's this?</i>

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.860
<i>It's the origin of worlds,</i>

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.030
<i>"The Seed".</i>

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.240
<i>Once it buds, you'll understand its nature.</i>

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.820
<i>After that, its fate is in your hands.</i>

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.240
<i>You can delete it or even forget about it.</i>

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.960
<i>However, if you hold any feelings
other than hatred for </i>that<i> world...</i>

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.250
Kirito-kun?

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.590
Come on, Kirito-kun.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.630
About today's offline meeting...

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.420
Oh, sorry.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.550
I was spacing out.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.970
Honestly, you...

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.260
Whether it's here or <i>there,</i> when you're relaxed,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.310
you become really carefree, huh?

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.860
Jeez, Lis—

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.030
Rika-san.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.150
Drink a bit more quietly.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.450
I can't help it.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.540
Oh, look at Kirito fawning all over her.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.580
It's inexcusable behavior at school.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.670
I don't approve of spying on them.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.630
If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't
have agreed to that one-month truce.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.970
<i>You're</i> the one who came up with it!

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.890
Saying that you wanted to let those two
enjoy a month of quality time together...

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.810
It was your naïveté speaking, really.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.440
Are you going to the offline meeting today?

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.440
Of course I am!

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.080
Hey, have you ever meet Agil before?

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.420
Yeah, we went hunting together twice or so.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.090
He's really big.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.260
Just so you know, he's no smaller in real life.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.590
Prepare yourself.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.520
Come on... We arrived on time.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.780
The stars of the show should be the last to appear.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.490
That's why we told you the time
was later than it really was.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.660
Now, come on in.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.620
Hey, wai—

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.200
Okay then, everyone.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.790
Let's have a cheer.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.040
One, two!

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.000
Kirito, congratulations on clearing SAO!

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.970
Here, take this.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.090
Cheers!

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.050
Cheers!

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.190
Bartender, one bourbon on the rocks.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.280
Oh, it's just oolong tea.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.740
Agil, give me a real one.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.660
Klein, you sure about that?

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.870
You're heading back to work after this, right?

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.710
Like I could pull overtime without a drink.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.370
Besides...

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.170
Exactly!

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.750
It's been a while.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.300
Thinker-san.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.420
Oh, right.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.220
I heard that you married Yulier-san.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.260
Though it's late, please accept my congratulations.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:58.060
Yes, well... It feels like I have my hands
full with adjusting back to reality.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.480
I'm finally getting ahold of work again, too.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.020
Man, that's great news!

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.070
By the way, I've been reading the new <i>MMO Today.</i>

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.820
Oh, how embarrassing.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.200
There still isn't much content in it.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.990
Besides, the way MMOs are now,

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.910
walkthrough info and other such
news are rather meaningless.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:21.370
It's comparable to the chaos accompanying
the birth of the universe, after all.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.090
Agil, how's it going? What happened to the seed?

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.670
You'd be amazed.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.630
There are around fifty mirror servers now.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.050
Downloads are numbering a hundred thousand.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.680
And there are about 300 major
servers that are making use of it.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.930
<i>After I saved Asuna,</i>

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.480
<i>I brought the World Seed that Kayaba left me to Agil,</i>

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.110
<i>and asked him to look into it.</i>

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.690
<i>As a result, I learned that the World Seed</i>

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.650
<i>was a program package called
"The Seed," that Kayaba developed,</i>

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:57.160
<i>which simulates a full-dive-type
virtual MMO environment.</i>

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.830
<i>Put simply,</i>

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.580
<i>if "The Seed" is downloaded onto a
server with decent enough bandwidth,</i>

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.080
<i>anyone could create their own online world with it.</i>

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.880
<i>So that it'd be available for anyone to use,</i>

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:14.890
<i>I asked Agil to upload it to servers worldwide.</i>

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.600
<i>And so, virtual MMOs, which were disappearing,</i>

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.640
<i>took flight once more.</i>

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:29.360
<i>Alfheim Online, too, was taken up
by new management and revived.</i>

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.400
<i>And Alfheim wasn't the only world that was reborn.</i>

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.490
<i>Smaller corporations, and even private ones...</i>

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.330
<i>Hundreds of organizations seized the opportunity,</i>

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.910
<i>and began operating their own virtual
game servers one after another.</i>

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.170
<i>They eventually became mutually linked.</i>

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.460
<i>And now, a system that allows
a character created in one game</i>

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.380
<i>to be converted into that of
another is being implemented.</i>

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.600
Hey, we're still on for the afterparty, right?

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.270
Yeah, tonight at eleven,

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.180
we'll be meeting at Yggdrasil City.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:04.200
I was worried about how high you were going to go.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.120
It's almost time, so I came to get you.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.370
Oh, thanks.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.380
Say, Onii—Kirito-kun.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.510
The management for ALO changed,

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.010
and you can use your SAO avatar now,

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:26.100
so why haven't you switched like the others?

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.480
The role of <i>that</i> world's Kirito is over now.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.150
I see.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.370
Then I'm the one who first met the Spriggan Kirito-kun

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.490
and traveled with him to Yggdrasil, huh?

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.210
Hey, Kirito-kun, let's dance.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.920
It's a recently developed high-level technique.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.090
While hovering, you slowly move sideways.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.390
Yeah, that's it. You're doing great!

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.700
Leafa?

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.330
I'll be going back for today.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.620
Huh? Why?

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.830
Because...

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.210
It's too far...

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.380
Where you are... Where everyone is...

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.840
I can't make it over there.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.140
Sugu...

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.180
That's not true.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.560
You can go anywhere you want
if you put your mind to it.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.830
Here it comes.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.090
Is there something up with the moon?

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.660
No way. Don't tell me that's...

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.170
That's right. It's the floating castle, Aincrad.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.670
But... why?

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:42.960
Why's it here?

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.880
I'm going to settle it.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:52.390
This time, I'll make it past all 100
floors and conquer that castle.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.680
Leafa,

00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:00.230
my stats were reset, so I'm pretty weak now.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.770
Lend me a hand, okay?

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.320
Yeah, I'll come.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.990
No matter the distance. I'll be with you.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.880
Hey! You're late, Kirito!

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.100
Come on! We're gonna leave you behind!

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.310
I'm going ahead!

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.850
Hurry!

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:38.890
Move it!

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.820
Come, let's go, Kirito-kun, Leafa-chan.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.870
Go on. Papa, hurry.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.550
All right! Here we go!

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:34.740
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:42.620
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:51.510
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:58.810
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:04.150
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:09.730
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:14.860
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:21.500
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.460
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.260
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:36.090
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.020
I wanna always be with you.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:45.270
I'll give you everything I have.
