WEBVTT

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.000
Everyone, attack!

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.130
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:23.060
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.860
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.160
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.410
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.130
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.260
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.720
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.850
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.520
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.360
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.530
I wanna always be with you.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.540
I'll give you everything I have.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.640
How many did we lose?

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.400
Fourteen people died.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.650
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.360
There are still 25 floors left to clear.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.870
Can we really make it all the way to the top?

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.100
Kirito-kun?

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.240
Kirito-kun, what are you—

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.500
System-granted immortality?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.130
What is the meaning of this, Commander?

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.840
This man's HP gauge is protected by the system

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.970
so that it never drops into the yellow zone.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.140
Ever since I got stuck here, there was one thing I didn't get.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.440
"Where is he observing us and controlling the world from?"

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.030
But I'd overlooked something obvious.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.910
It's something even a child would know.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.120
There's nothing more boring than watching others play an RPG from the sidelines.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.420
Don't you agree,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.670
Kayaba Akihiko?

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.800
For future reference, mind sharing how you figured it out?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.350
The first time I suspected
something was during our duel.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.930
In that last split second, you moved far too quickly.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.940
I guessed as much.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.060
That was a mistake on my part.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.190
Overwhelmed by your attacks,

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.440
I carelessly activated the system's over-assist mode.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.540
Yes, I am Kayaba Akihiko.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.910
And if I may add,

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.460
I'm also the final boss who was supposed to await you all on the top floor.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.510
That's one twisted scenario.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.010
Turning the strongest player into the ultimate boss...

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.720
Not a bad twist, don't you think?

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.980
I expected that the one who'd be standing before me at the end would be you.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.610
The Dual-Wielding skill is granted to the player with the fastest reflexes,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.400
who would then become the hero that confronts the demon king.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.830
However, your strength has exceeded my expectations.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.750
Well, I suppose such unexpected events are what make MMORPGs so enjoyable.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.210
You had our loyalty... our hopes...

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.090
How dare you... How dare you...

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.670
How dare you!

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.050
Paralysis?

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.310
Kirito-kun...

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.360
What are you planning?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.070
Are you going to kill us all to conceal the truth?

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.410
God, no.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.740
I wouldn't do something so unreasonable.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.490
It seems I have no choice.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.040
Within the Ruby Palace on the top floor, I shall await for your arrival.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.960
It's a shame that I have to abandon

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.550
the Knights of the Blood, from which I raised from nothing,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.260
as well as the rest of the Clearing Group partway.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.220
No matter.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.550
With your skills, I'm sure you'll make it.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.260
But before we part ways...

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.730
Kirito-kun. You deserve a reward for uncovering my identity.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.480
I'll offer you a chance.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.770
A chance?

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.740
The chance to fight me one-on-one, right here, right now.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.700
Naturally, I will disable my immortality.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.280
Defeat me, and the game will be cleared,

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.120
allowing all players to log out.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.080
How about it?

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.330
Don't do it, Kirito-kun.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.420
For now... For now, just stand down.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.910
Not on my life.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.200
Fine by me. Let's settle this.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.710
Kirito-kun!

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.080
I'm sorry, but I can't back down now.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.420
You're aren't going... to die, right?

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.630
Yeah.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.260
I'll win no matter what.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.590
I'll beat him, and put an end to this world.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.970
All right.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.390
I believe in you, Kirito-kun.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.820
Kirito!

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:44.490
Agil.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.620
Thanks for all of your support towards the swordsman class.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.290
I know that virtually all of your profits

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.840
go into the training of players on the middle floors.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.130
Klein.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.760
I'm sorry... for leaving you behind that day.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.430
Goddamn it, Kirito!

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.930
Don't you apologize to me!

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.390
Don't you dare apologize right now!

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.940
I won't forgive you...

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.230
Not until you treat me to a meal in the real world, you hear?!

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.070
Sure thing.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.610
See you on the other side.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.210
If you don't mind, I have a request.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.420
What is it?

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.040
I don't plan to go down easily,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.920
but if I die,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.430
I want you to ensure that Asuna cannot commit suicide, at least for a while.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.890
Very well.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.100
Kirito-kun, don't say that!

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.680
You can't... You can't do this to me!

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.610
Kirito-kun!

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.660
<i>This is not a duel.</i>

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.570
<i>This is a fight to the death.</i>

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.540
<i>That's right. I'm going to...</i>

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.500
<i>kill him! </i>

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.050
<i>He's the one who designed the Dual-Wielding skill.</i>

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.300
<i>He can predict all of the combos built into the system.</i>

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.930
<i>I can't rely on Sword Skills. I can only trust in myself!</i>

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.650
<i>Faster...</i>

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.900
<i>I have to move faster!</i>

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.930
<i>I'm sorry, Asuna.</i>

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.810
<i>Live on without me.</i>

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.860
Farewell, Kirito-kun.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.220
It can't be.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.180
Asuna. You can't... You can't just...

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.320
I'm sorry.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:09.990
Goodbye.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.340
My, what a surprise.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.350
It shouldn't be possible to recover from paralysis independently.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.060
I guess these things happen too.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.360
<i>This is... it...</i>

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.780
<i>I believe in you, Kirito-kun.</i>

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.380
Not yet.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.810
I'm not done yet!

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.380
<i>Was that... enough?</i>

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.370
As of November 7th, 2:55 PM,

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.960
the game has been cleared.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.840
The game has been cleared.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.570
Commencing final phase

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.900
Where am I?

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.120
Kirito-kun?

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.930
Sorry. I died too.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.140
You idiot.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.990
Where are we?

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.510
Quite the view, isn't it?

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.770
Kayaba Akihiko.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:59.440
As we speak, on the fifth basement floor of Argus HQ, the memory banks in the SAO mainframe

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.110
is being purged of every byte.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.120
In another ten minutes, everything in this world will be deleted.

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.080
What happened to the players in there?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.960
No need to worry.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:21.960
Moments ago, all 6147 surviving players were successfully logged out.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.430
What about the dead?

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.050
What about the four thousand players who lost their lives?

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.600
They will never regain consciousness.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.350
No matter what world we are in, the dead do not return.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.440
Why?

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.150
Why did you do all this?

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.110
Why, you ask?

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.740
For a long time, I'd forgotten.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.120
I wonder why.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.910
When I began developing the
 Full-Dive Environment System—

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.380
No, long before that, I lived longing for nothing but to create that castle—

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:05.090
a world that surpasses the laws and boundaries of reality.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.510
And now,

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:12.720
I've borne witness to someone who's
surpassed even my own world's laws.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:21.770
I wonder how old I was when I became entranced by that steel castle floating in the sky.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.030
I wanted to leave the earth behind

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.110
and go to that castle.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:32.200
For a long, long time, that was my only desire.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.660
You see, Kirito-kun,

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.130
I still believe.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:44.880
In some other world, that castle truly exists.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.140
Yeah, it'd be nice if it did.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.730
That reminds me.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.310
Congratulations on clearing the game,

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.440
Kirito-kun, Asuna-kun.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.150
Now then, I'll be on my way.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.130
I guess this is goodbye.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.090
No,

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.050
it isn't.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.270
We'll disappear together as one,

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.350
so we'll never part again.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.110
Hey, before that, tell me your name.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.110
Your real name.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:49.530
Kirigaya.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.150
Kirigaya Kazuto.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.700
I think I turned sixteen last month.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.620
Kirigaya Kazuto-kun...

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.580
So you <i>are</i> younger than me.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.250
My name is Yuuki Asuna.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.670
I'm seventeen.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.880
Yuuki... Asuna...

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.840
Yuuki Asuna.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.060
I'm sorry.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.430
I'm so sorry.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.600
I promised that I'd send you back...

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.600
to the real world...

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.690
But I...

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.770
I...

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.110
It's okay.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.450
Don't cry.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.370
I'm glad.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:41.120
I was able to meet you and live together with you.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.500
It was the happiest time of my life.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.130
Thank you.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.590
I love you.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.980
I love...

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.650
I love you.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.720
Asu...na...

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.100
Asuna...

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:39.820
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:51.630
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.630 --> 00:23:03.430
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:14.020
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:25.080
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:37.670
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:44.470
Softly, softly shining
