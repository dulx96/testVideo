00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.070
<i>One month has passed since the game started</i>

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.540
<i>and during that time, 2000 people have died.</i>

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.500
<i>However, not one person...</i>

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.460
<i>has cleared the 1st floor.</i>

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.130
<i>Not even I, who was a beta tester, have been able to reach the boss room.</i>

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:40.010
<i>But today, a boss fight conference for the 1st floor will be held.</i>

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.110
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:04.040
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.840
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.140
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.390
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.110
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.240
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.700
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.830
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.500
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.340
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.510
I wanna always be with you.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.520
I'll give you everything I have.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.410
Listen up!

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.030
I'll be starting the conference now!

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.790
Thank you, everyone, for responding to my invitation.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.420
My name's Diabel, and my class is...

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.250
informally, Knight!

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.130
There's no class system, you know.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.090
"Knight", he says.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.720
Is this meeting a joke, too?

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.100
Today, on the highest level of this floor, my party discovered the boss room!

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.600
Seriously?

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.150
By defeating the floor boss and reaching the 2nd floor...

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.070
we'll be able to show everyone in Starting Town that this death game <i>can</i> be cleared!

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.990
It's our responsibility to do so!

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.410
Don't you agree, everyone?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.420
Okay.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.090
Now, I'd like to begin discussing our battle strategy.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.300
For starters, we're going to split up into parties of six.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.010
Of course, we'll be in the same party.
placeholder

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.220
The floor boss can't be defeated with simple parties.
Of course, we'll be in the same party.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.720
The floor boss can't be defeated with simple parties.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.560
Then I'll be the leader.
The floor boss can't be defeated with simple parties.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.230
We'll need to assemble multiple parties to form a raid group!
Then I'll be the leader.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.350
We'll need to assemble multiple parties to form a raid group!

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.060
I'll be counting on you.
We'll need to assemble multiple parties to form a raid group!

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.070
Did you get left out too?

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.160
I wasn't left out.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.500
The others seemed to be friends already, so I didn't want to join them.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.460
So you're a solo player?
How about partying with me, then?

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.340
He said that the boss can't be fought alone, right? It'll just be for this once.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.570
All right! Are you guys done partying?

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.780
Now—

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.030
Hold it!

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.290
The name's Kibaou.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.670
There's something that I need to get off my chest.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.920
I'm positive that there are some amongst you that should be apologizing to those who've died so far.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.180
Kibaou-san, the people that you're referring to are the beta testers, correct?

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.600
Of course I am!

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.360
On the day that this crappy game started, the beta testers disappeared, abandoning all us beginners.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.370
They monopolized the good hunting grounds and profitable quests, prioritizing themselves over others.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.370
And afterwards, they feigned ignorance for doing so.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.250
Some of you are sure to be beta testers!

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.000
We should have them kneel in apology and hand over the money and items they've been hoarding!

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.800
I cannot and <i>will</i> not entrust my life to such people!

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.140
Mind if I speak?

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.360
My name is Agil.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.650
Kibaou-san, basically you're saying that

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.240
the beta testers should take
 responsibility for the many deaths

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.790
by apologizing and offering reparations because they didn't look after us new players, right?

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.750
Y-Yeah.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.710
This is the guidebook... I believe you have one too.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.750
It's up for free at the item shop, after all.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.510
I do. What about it?

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.260
The people who distributed these... were former beta testers.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.970
Really?

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.430
Listen, this information was available to everyone,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.350
yet many players died.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.320
What I thought we'd be doing here was planning how to fight the boss

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.860
using what we learned from these deaths.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.410
H-He's right.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.420
Okay.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.340
May I continue?

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.550
About the boss...

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.130
The truth is, the guidebook that was just mentioned had information about it in its latest version.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.390
According to this, the boss is called Illfang the Kobold Lord.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.890
Also, he has mobs called Ruin Kobold Sentinels guarding him.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.560
His arms consist of an axe and a buckler.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.820
When the last of his four health bars becomes red,

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.400
he switches to a curved sword called a <i>talwar</i>.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.070
His attack patterns also change.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.370
Amazing.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.290
That information's thorough.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.450
Wow...

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.410
That concludes the conference.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.920
Lastly, concerning loot distribution...

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.880
the money is automatically distributed,

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.340
EXP goes to the party that lands the last hit,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.760
and items belong to whoever gets them.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.430
Any objections?

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.600
Sounds good.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.480
Okay, we'll leave at ten in the morning tomorrow.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.440
You're all dismissed!

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.730
It tastes pretty good, doesn't it?

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.850
Mind if I sit here?

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.410
Do you really think it's good?

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.580
Of course.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.790
I've been eating it at least once a day since I got here.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.710
I put a little twist on it, though.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.210
A twist?

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.840
Try putting this on the bread.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.810
Cream?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.170
It was my reward for a quest called "The Cow Strikes Back" from the previous town.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.090
If you want, I can tell you how to beat it.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.640
I didn't come to this town so that I could eat good food.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.560
Then why did you?

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.390
So I could remain as myself.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:02.780
I'd rather survive as myself than slowly rot away in an inn back in Starting Town.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.780
Even if I end up dead at the hands of a monster,

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.740
This game...

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.080
This world, is something I won't give in to.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.790
No matter what.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.090
I don't want a party member to die on me.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.340
Worry about your life more, at least for tomorrow.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.140
Let's review the plan.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.010
We loners are to target

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.390
the guard mobs called Ruin Kobold Sentinels.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.690
I know.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.650
I'll deflect their pole axes with a sword skill,

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.530
so switch in at that moment.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.650
Switch?

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.580
Could this be your first time in a party?

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.490
Yes.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.550
Listen up, everyone.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.760
I have just one thing to say.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.100
Let's win!

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.680
Here we go!

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.340
Commence attack!

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.770
Squad A! Squad C! Switch!

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.730
Here it comes! Squad B, block!

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.570
Squad C, continue guarding and prepare to switch.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.570
Now!

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.450
Continue switching and prepare to target the flank!

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.620
Squads D, E, and F! Keep the Sentinels off us!

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.330
Roger!

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.830
Switch!

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.420
This is the third!

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.090
<i>I thought she was a novice,</i>

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.920
<i>but she has incredible dexterity.</i>

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.550
<i>She's so fast, I can't see the tip of her blade!</i>

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:37.970
Good job.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.490
Just like the guidebook said.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.620
Stand back.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.080
I'll go!

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.040
<i>This is when we should have everyone surround it...</i>

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.640
<i>That's not a </i>talwar<i>—it's a </i>nodachi<i>!</i>

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.430
This is different from the beta!

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.350
Stop!

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.520
Jump back as far as you can!

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.860
Diabel-han!

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.620
Diabel!

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.580
Why'd you go alone?

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.300
You were...

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.590
a beta tester, right?

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.550
I'm sure you know.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.270
The rare item that comes with the last attack bonus.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.850
You were a beta tester, too?

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.900
Please...

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.070
defeat...

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.860
defeat the boss...

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.240
for everyone.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.790
<i>When this death game started,</i>

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.840
<i>I only worried about my own survival.</i>

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.670
<i>Then... see you, Klein.</i>

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:42.180
<i>But Diabel, despite being a beta tester,</i>

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.850
<i>didn't abandon other players.</i>

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.100
<i>You became a leader and fought bravely!</i>

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.310
<i>You tried to do what I could not.</i>

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.070
I'll help.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.030
Thanks.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.120
Our strategy's the same as with the Sentinels!

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.670
Got it.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.220
Switch!

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.430
Asuna!

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.070
He's coming back!

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.550
Dammit!

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.490
We'll hold him off until you recover!

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.660
You're...

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.080
Watch out!

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.670
Reach it!

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.800
Asuna!

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.260
One last hit! Help me out!

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.850
Roger!

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.550
W-We did it!

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.570
Good work.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.570
That was some remarkable swordsmanship.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.120
Congratulations.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.660
This victory belongs to you.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.700
No...

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.880
Why?!

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.560
Why... Why'd you let Diabel-han die?

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.390
Let him die?

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.060
Exactly!

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.810
You knew the boss's moves!

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:25.530
If you shared what you knew
beforehand, he wouldn't have died!

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.370
He must have been a beta tester!

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.750
That's how he knew the boss's attack patterns.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.710
He knew, but didn't tell us!

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.210
And he's not the only one, is he?

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.010
Admit it, beta testers!

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.020
<i>This is bad.</i>

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.570
<i>At this rate...</i>

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.110
<i>...for everyone.</i>

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.120
Hey, you...

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.340
A beta tester?

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.890
Don't put me in the same category as those newbies.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.060
W-What?!

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.980
The majority of SAO's one thousand beta testers...

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.320
were amateurs who didn't even know how to level.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.110
Even you guys are better than them.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.780
But I, for one, am different.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:03.330
During the beta test, I reached floors that nobody else could.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.670
I knew the boss's attack patterns because

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:10.010
I've fought plenty of katana-wielding
monsters on floors far above this one.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.470
I know a lot more than that, too.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.890
More than any information broker.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.140
W-What?

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.930
That's...

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.150
Forget about being a beta tester!

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.650
You're a cheater! A cheater!

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.610
Yeah, a cheater!

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:28.860
Both a beta tester and cheater...

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.570
so you're a beater!

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.610
"Beater"...

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.410
That's not a bad name.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.830
That's right. I'm a beater.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.080
From now on, don't think of me as a mere beta tester.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.310
Wait.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.860
During the battle, you said my name, right?

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.400
Sorry for addressing you informally.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.860
Or did I pronounce it wrong?

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.160
How did you know it?

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:20.700
You can see an HP bar that isn't your own around here, right?

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.120
Isn't something written next to it?

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.420
Ki-ri-to...

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.460
Kirito?

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.210
Is that your name?

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.300
Yeah.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.680
Wow, it's been there all the time, huh?

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.100
You can become strong.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:50.070
So if someone trustworthy ever invites you to their guild, don't turn them down.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.650
There's a definite limit for solo players, after all.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.820
Then what about you?

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:39.660
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:51.460
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.460 --> 00:23:03.260
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:13.860
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:24.910
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:37.510
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:44.300
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
