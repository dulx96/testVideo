WEBVTT

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.530
Asuna?

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.700
Asuna!

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.040
I've...

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.340
become a real crybaby, Asuna.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.890
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.310
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.870
Seeking but a miracle,
kiseki dake wo motome

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.040
I wander in the unrelenting darkness
kienai yami wo samayou

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:40.760
If I remain here, I'll only be trapped in the present.
doko ni ireba nidoto mirai miru koto dekinai

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.390
The moon beckons again tonight,
koyoi mo tsuki ga sasotte

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.100
and while I still can't voice my feelings,
mada kotoba dasenai kedo

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.890
I continue to scream inside my heart.
kokoro no naka sakebitsuzuketa

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.280
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.320
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.910
If only I could have become a little bit stronger,
ato honno sukoshi dake tsuyoku nareta nara

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.170
I would have flown far above these skies
me no mae ni aru kono sora koete yuku kara

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.260
and reached out to the future beyond here.
kono saki ni aru mirai ni te wo nobasu kara

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.240
We really... don't look alike, do we?

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.920
Onii-chan, I'm off to club practice.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.840
Morning, Sugu.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.100
M-Morning.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.720
Jeez.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.480
At least tell me if you're gonna watch.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.480
Well, I didn't want to interrupt.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.650
I wouldn't have minded.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.150
It's just part of my routine now.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.950
I see.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.200
You stuck with it, after all.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.700
It's light.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.700
Huh?

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.710
It's made of madake bamboo, so it's pretty heavy.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.630
Oh, yeah...

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.380
Um...

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.880
I expected it be heavier; maybe it's just by comparison...

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.890
In comparison to what exactly?

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.020
Say, why don't we have a go?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.560
Have a go?

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.060
You mean a match?

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.570
Yeah.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.400
With the guards on and everything?

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.320
We could just do it with no contact,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.950
but I don't want to risk accidentally hurting you.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.040
We still have Grandpa's gear, right?

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.830
Let's do it in the dojo.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.080
Oh?

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.170
Well, aren't you rather confident for someone who's been comatose for two years?

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.630
I wonder if you can make me, one of the top eight competitors in the Nationals, even break a sweat.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.510
Besides, are you really feeling up to it?

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.180
You shouldn't overexert yourself.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.650
I'll show you the results of my daily rehab at the gym.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.000
What's that supposed to be, Onii-chan?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.870
Don't mind me.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.710
This is my personal sword style.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.880
Here I come.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.210
Okay.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.340
<i>His head is wide open.</i>

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.470
<i>I'll take a good strike there...</i>

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.220
<i>Huh?</i>

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.430
<i>For some reason, I can't see any openings...</i>

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.240
<i>Then how about...</i>

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.180
A-Are you all right, Onii-chan?

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.850
Wow, you got me good.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.600
You're strong, Sugu.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.070
Heathcliff doesn't hold a candle to you.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.860
Are you really all right?

00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:59.690
Yeah...

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.900
Let's call it a day.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.590
Did I hit you too hard?

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.300
Th-That's not it! It's just an old habit!

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.300
Footwork aside, my attacks are the problem.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.100
I guess I can't recreate my sword skills without the system-assist, after all.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.310
At any rate, you really surprised me.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.060
Onii-chan, have you been practicing?

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.230
More or less.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.940
But it's really fun.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.400
Maybe I'll try out kendo again.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.780
Really?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.650
Will you really?!

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.450
Sugu, will you teach me?

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.370
O-Of course!

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.080
Let's train together again!

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.870
Once I'm in better shape, okay?

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.170
You know, Onii-chan.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.550
I'm also...

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.720
Actually, forget I said anything.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.390
What is it?

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.430
What are your plans for today?

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.150
Today, I'm...

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.190
going to the hospital.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.230
I see.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.660
So you're going to visit... <i>her</i>, right?

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.910
Asuna-san, was it?

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.370
Yeah.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.620
That's all I can do for her, after all.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.460
Well then, it's my turn to make breakfast today,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.050
so you can go ahead and take a shower first.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.220
Okay.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.430
<i>Two months ago,</i>

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.890
<i>I defeated Heathcliff and cleared that game of death.</i>

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.400
<i>Soon after I woke up, I offered inside information regarding SAO to a government official</i>

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.400
<i>from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications' SAO Incident Task Force</i>

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.700
<i>in exchange for Asuna's whereabouts.</i>

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.670
<i>What I learned as a result</i>

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.550
<i>was that she was at Tokorozawashi
General Hospital in Saitama Prefecture,</i>

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:33.720
<i>and that around 300 players, including Asuna, hadn't woken up yet.</i>

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.230
<i>To the public's outrage,</i>

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.690
<i>the conspiracy that Kayaba Akihiko had started before disappearing still hadn't ended.</i>

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.740
<i>The SAO Incident hasn't ended yet.</i>

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.210
Asuna...

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.390
Oh,

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.220
so you were here, Kirigaya-kun.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.520
Thanks for visiting so often.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.770
Good afternoon.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.810
Pardon the intrusion, Yuuki-san.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.320
No, not at all. Feel free to visit whenever.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.990
I'm sure my daughter would like that too.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.990
President.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.620
Oh, it's your first time meeting him, isn't it?

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.750
This is Sugou-kun, the man in
charge of our research institute.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.630
I'm Sugou Nobuyuki.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.840
Nice to meet you.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.550
I'm Kirigaya Kazuto.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:56.430
Really? So you're <i>that hero, Kirito-kun!</i>

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.720
Oh, my apologies.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.350
Inside information regarding SAO was confidential, wasn't it?

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.690
He's the son of a good friend of mine,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.240
so I always considered him as close as family.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.910
Well, President, regarding that...

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.660
I'd like it if you made an official decision now.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.410
Oh, that's right.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.920
But are you sure about this?

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.340
You're still young. You have your whole life ahead of you.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.920
I made up my mind long ago.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.930
While Asuna-san still remains as her beautiful self,

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.010
I'd like to have her wear a dress.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.100
I guess you're right...

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.940
It may be time for me to make a decision.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:52.700
Sorry to leave so abruptly, but I have a meeting to attend.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.990
We'll finish this discussion at another time.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.700
Kirigaya-kun. Let's meet again.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.090
I heard that inside that game, you lived together with Asuna?

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.840
Yes.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.310
In that case, I suppose you and I have a rather complicated relationship.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.320
What we were discussing just now

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.400
was the marriage of Asuna and me.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.450
As if you could possibly do that.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.500
True, we can't file for an official marriage,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:50.460
so instead, I'll be adopted by the Yuuki family as their son.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:56.880
To tell the truth, she's never been very fond of me.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.470
Her parents are oblivious to that,

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:04.350
but if the subject of marriage was ever brought up, chances are she'd reject it.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:09.560
So from my standpoint, this situation is extremely convenient.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.690
Stop it.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.450
Are you planning to take advantage of Asuna's comatose state?

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.040
"Take advantage of"?

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.330
No,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.620
it's my legitimate right.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.710
Hey, Kirigaya-kun.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:36.630
Do you know what happened to Argus, the developer of SAO, afterward?

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.050
I heard it was dissolved.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.970
Correct.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.890
On top of development costs,

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:46.180
the company had to compensate the victims of the incident,

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.190
and was run into the ground by debt.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.560
The maintenance of the SAO servers was entrusted to

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:59.240
the general appliance manufacturer of which Yuuki Shouzou-shi is the CEO: RCT.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.830
I'm also the director of RCT's
Full-Dive research department.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:11.250
In other words, it wouldn't be wrong to
say Asuna's life is being sustained by me.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:17.210
Considering that, don't I deserve a little compensation?

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:23.600
I don't know what you promised the girl inside that game,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.720
but I'd like you to never come back here again.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.440
Stay away from the Yuuki family while you're at it.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:37.530
The ceremony will be held in a week,
on January 26th, in this hospital room.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.320
I only regret that it's not a traditionally auspicious wedding date.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.530
It <i>is a day for sharing fortune, so you're invited.</i>

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:50.960
Make the most of your last
meeting with her, Hero Boy.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.010
Onii-chan, the bath's free.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:12.020
Onii-chan! If you're here, at least answer.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.690
The heater's not even on. Something wrong?

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.320
Sorry.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.990
Can you leave me alone for a bit?

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.780
But it's so cold in here—

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.450
Wh-What's wrong?

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.290
Nothing.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.500
But...

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.710
you're freezing.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.590
You'll catch a cold.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.170
You should warm up in the bath.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.800
I'm... no good.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.140
Even after I resolved never to show
weakness in front of you no matter what...

00:16:54.390 --> 00:17:00.440
Did something happen to her—to Asuna-san?

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.740
Asuna is going to go far away.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.950
To somewhere I can't reach.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.270
Hey, don't give in so soon.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:38.020
You shouldn't give up so easily on the one you love.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.990
<i>I can't...</i>

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:49.740
<i>lie to myself anymore either.</i>

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.710
I can still remember like it was yesterday...

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:06.970
the time Kazuto suddenly asked about his real parents.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.930
I was really surprised then.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.760
He was only ten years old,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.230
but he noticed the deleted records on the
Resident Registers Network all on his own.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.230
Jeez, that sounds like something he'd do.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.820
I was so surprised, I let my guard down.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:30.780
So I carelessly spilled the beans that my older sister and her husband were his real parents.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.040
Say, Mom.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.210
What is it?

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.880
Do you think that's related to why

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.210
Onii-chan started playing online games all day

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.590
once he got into middle school?

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.590
Of course not.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:54.850
After all, by the time he was six, he was already building his own machines using spare parts.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:59.350
If anything, he must've inherited my obsession with computers.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.100
On a mental level at least.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.690
Well then, I'll head back home first, okay?

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.780
You shouldn't stay too late either.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.070
Okay, I won't.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.750
Happy birthday.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:31.260
It still hasn't really sunk in that Onii-chan and I are cousins.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.430
Onii-chan.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:07.250
<i>But, Onii-chan's heart...</i>

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.180
<i>Onii-chan's heart...</i>

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.720
<i>already belongs to </i>her.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.110
Hey, wake up, Sugu.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.700
It's already morning.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.750
Come on, wake up.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.040
You're losing time for morning practice.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.390
Oh, morning, Onii-chan.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.180
Morning.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.940
Morning.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.740
Um...

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.870
I...

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.460
Oh, dear.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.920
<i>You shouldn't give up...</i>

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.430
Yeah. That's right.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.610
This is...

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.170
Asuna?

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:22.810
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:32.650
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.500
My endless feelings are lost
tomedonai omoi wa

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.080
in these ordinary days.
nichijou ni nomarete

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:58.260
They waver and change shape yet again.
yurameki nagara mata katachi wo kaeteitta

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.850
I wonder if I'm too late,
imasara mou osoi kana

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.310
but there's no answer in sight.
henji mo nai jimonjitou

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.310
Every decision is up to me,
subete wa sou jibun shidai

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:12.940
whether it's the beginning or the end.
owari mo hajimari mo

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:19.990
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands.
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:27.120
Flying towards the gentle light, I flap my wings.
yasashii hikari wo mezashite habatakuyo

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.210
I embrace the passion
kokoro ni tomoshita

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.420
that flared up in my heart
jounetsu mo daite

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:42.510
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
