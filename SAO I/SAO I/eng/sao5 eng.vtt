WEBVTT

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.330
We'll lure the Field Boss into the village.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.910
W-Wait a second.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.790
If we did that, the villagers—

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.250
That's our aim.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.170
While the boss is occupied with killing NPCs,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.130
we'll take it down.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.880
NPCs aren't just bits of data like trees or rocks.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.180
They're—

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.470
Alive?

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.090
Is that it?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.220
There's nothing special about them.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.940
Even if they're killed, they'll simply respawn.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.190
I can't accept that logic.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.240
I, Asuna, the Vice Commander of the Knights of Blood,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.900
am assigned to lead this mission.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.990
You will obey my orders.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.210
Yo.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.670
Another quarrel, huh?

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.750
Agil.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.300
Why do you two always end up arguing?

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.140
I guess we just think differently.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.010
<i>You can become strong.</i>

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.020
<i>So if someone trustworthy ever invites you to their guild, don't turn them down.</i>

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.900
That's what I said,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.770
but I never thought she'd join the strongest one

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.820
and become a floor-clearing demon.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.080
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:57.010
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:05.810
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.110
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.360
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.080
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.210
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.670
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.800
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.470
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.310
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.480
I wanna always be with you.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.490
I'll give you everything I have.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.050
What are you doing?

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.850
Oh,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.230
it's just you.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.900
The others are frantically
working to clear the dungeon,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.360
so why are you lazing around napping?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.900
Being a solo player doesn't excuse you from—

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.650
The weather today is the nicest possible

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.820
during the nicest season in Aincrad.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.410
It'd be a waste to spend a day like this in a dungeon.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.750
Don't you get it?

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.960
Every day that passes here

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.710
is a day lost to us in the real world.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.470
But right now, we're living in the world of Aincrad.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.550
See?

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.930
The sun and wind are so relaxing.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.520
Really?

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.690
It doesn't seem that different from usual.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.110
If you laid down for a bit, you'd understand.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.320
Well, would you look at that?

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.940
Sleeping in broad daylight?

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.780
They're too laidback for their own good.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.160
Honestly, who do they think they are?

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.080
I didn't expect her to listen to me...

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.690
Huh? Uh... wha...

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.900
Morning.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.940
Sleep well?

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.040
One meal.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.040
A meal!

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.380
I'll treat you to whatever you want.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.050
Then we'll call it even, okay?

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.730
Isn't she Asuna from the Knights of Blood?

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.190
So she's the Flash...

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.940
Who's the guy in black?

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.990
Well, how should I say this...?

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.320
Thanks for today.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.990
For watching over me.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.700
Oh, no problem.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.580
The towns are safe areas,

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.170
so there's no risk of being attacked or player-killed,

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.670
but it's different when you're asleep.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.790
Yeah.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.760
There's sleep-PKing, which takes advantage of the duel system.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.890
Normally, duels are held to test one's strength.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.060
But during one, damage can be taken, reducing HP,

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.810
even in a safe area.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.770
You can challenge someone who's asleep,

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.610
and move their finger to make them accept the duel request.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.110
Then you attack them until they die.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.570
It's not unheard of.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.120
So, um...

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.780
Thank you.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.080
W-Well, uh...

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.290
Y-You're welcome.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.690
Hurry and pull it out!

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.820
Stay down here and catch him.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.860
Got it.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:03.450
Hang on!

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.910
Damn...

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.930
<i>The only way to die in a safe area</i>

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.680
<i>is to get killed during a duel.</i>

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.140
<i>Which means...</i>

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.560
Everyone!

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.640
Look for a "Winner" duel notification!

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.480
There's nobody inside.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.210
What's the meaning of this?

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.170
The most obvious explanation would be

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.710
that the murderer impaled the victim,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.720
put the noose around his neck, and shoved him out the window.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.010
Wouldn't you agree?

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.010
But a "Winner" notification was nowhere to be seen.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.720
That's impossible.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.060
Damaging someone in a safe area

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.600
is only possible during a du—

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.650
Either way, we can't ignore this incident.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.240
Yeah.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.620
If someone's found a way to PK even in safe areas,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.160
then towns can't be considered secure anymore.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.750
Agreed.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.670
We'll have to leave the front lines,

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.080
but this takes precedence.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.380
Well then, you'll have to assist me until this is resolved.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.130
And just so we're clear, we won't have time for naps.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.800
But you slept even longer than I did...

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.360
Excuse me.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.150
Does anyone know exactly what happened earlier?

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.990
If you do, please tell us about it.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.330
When I got here he was already...

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:14.950
Same here.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.420
Sorry, I know you're going through some trauma.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.090
What's your name?

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.880
U-Um... my name is Yolko.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.680
By any chance, did that scream earlier come from you?

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.470
Y-Yes.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.100
Earlier I...

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.310
came to have dinner with the man who was murdered.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.060
His name was Caynz,

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.190
and he used to be in the same guild as me.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.690
So when we got separated in the plaza,

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:48.820
I went to look for him and saw him hanging from the church window...

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.740
Did you see anyone else?

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.080
It was just for a moment,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.830
but I thought I saw someone behind Caynz.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.300
Did that person look familiar?

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.380
No...

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.550
Um... I hate to ask this,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:16.180
but do you have any idea why someone would want to kill Caynz-san?

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.560
No...

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.910
I'm sorry

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.120
for having you escort me.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.240
Don't worry about it.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.450
Well then, we can continue our talk tomorrow, if that's fine with you.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.830
Sure.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.540
So, what now?

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.880
Let's go over what we know.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.970
If we trace the spear's origins,

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.350
it could give us a lead.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.510
We'll need to use the Appraisal skill then.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.100
You don't...

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.520
have it leveled, do you?

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.440
Obviously not.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.230
And neither do you.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.060
Anyways,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.570
can you stop addressing me so rudely?

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.980
O-O-Oh...

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.990
Then, uh...

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.490
How about "Miss"?

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.410
"Vice Commander-sama"?

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.620
"Flash-sama"?

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.120
Just call me Asuna.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.080
R-Roger that.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.460
So, about the Appraisal skill,

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.130
do you know anyone who could help us with it?

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.090
Hm...

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.710
I have a friend who's a blacksmith,

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:35.090
but she's really busy around this time, so we might have to wait a while.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.140
I see.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.390
Then let's go ask a merchant acquaintance of mine.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.320
Thank you! Come again, sir.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.240
Looks like

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.610
you're carrying out your greedy business as usual.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.320
Oh, Kirito.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.080
My motto's always been "Buy cheap, sell cheap".

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.160
The second part's pretty fishy.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.670
Don't speak so ill of me.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.130
Wh-Wh-What's going on, Kirito?

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.180
Why's a solo player like you with <i>Asuna of all people?</i>

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.470
Weren't you two always at odds?

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.430
Say something!

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.430
Someone got killed in a safe area?

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.350
It wasn't during a duel?

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.020
We didn't see a "Winner" notification anywhere.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.020
If he was walking with Yolko-san beforehand,

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.230
it couldn't have been a sleep-PK either.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:36.030
The setup is too complicated to have been the result of a random duel.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.830
We can be certain that it was premeditated murder.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.120
And then there's this.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.670
It's player-made.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.380
Really?

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.470
Who was the one that made it?

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.430
Grimlock.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.220
Never heard of him...

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.850
But I do know that he's not a first-rate swordsmith.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.350
And there's nothing particularly strange about this weapon.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.850
Still, it should give us a clue.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.110
Just in case, tell us the item name too.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.320
Let's see...

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.150
It's called Guilty Thorn,

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.740
meaning "thorn of sin".

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.030
The thorn of sin...

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.380
Now then...

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.460
Wait!

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.470
Why?

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.970
Why do you think?

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.550
Are you an idiot?!

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.060
Someone's been killed by that weapon!

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.060
I know,

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.690
but we can't figure anything out without trying.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.110
Don't bother trying something that dangerous!

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.610
This... should be left with Agil-san.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.730
Huh? Okay...

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.330
Hey, Yolko-san.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.000
Have you ever heard of the name "Grimlock"?

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.210
Yes.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.880
He was a member of the guild that Caynz and I were in together.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.180
The truth is, we appraised the spear that Caynz-san was killed with

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.020
and found that it was created by Grimlock-san.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.110
Can you think of a reason why this might be?

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.110
Yes, I can.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.200
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this yesterday.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.660
I want to forget about it.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.620
It's not something that I want to remember.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.080
However, I'll tell you about it.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.590
About the reason for our guild's destruction.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.600
<i>The name of our guild was "Golden Apple".</i>

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.180
<i>Six months ago,</i>

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.640
<i>we defeated a rare monster that we encountered</i>

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.060
<i>and it dropped a ring that raised one's Agility by 20 levels.</i>

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.270
<i>Some of us wanted to use it,</i>

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.610
<i>while others wanted to sell it and split the earnings, ultimately dividing the guild.</i>

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.820
<i>But in the end, the matter was resolved by voting.</i>

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.950
<i>The result was 5-3, in favor of selling it.</i>

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.960
<i>Our leader, Griselda-san,</i>

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.210
<i>left to stay overnight at a large town on the front lines</i>

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.790
<i>to consign the ring to an auctioneer.</i>

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.090
<i>But Griselda-san never came back.</i>

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:51.480
Later, we discovered that she had died.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:56.230
I still don't know the cause of her death.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.730
Nobody would leave a safe area carrying such a rare item,

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.570
which means she might've been sleep-PKed.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.160
Sleep-PKing wasn't widely known six months ago.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.910
Still, it's hard to believe that it was a coincidence.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.790
Whoever attacked Griselda-san must've known about the ring as well.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:16.540
In other words...

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.130
One of the seven other members of Golden Apple...

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:26.890
The obvious suspects would be those who voted against selling the ring.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.890
So you're saying they attacked Griselda-san

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.810
to get the ring before she consigned it?

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.100
Probably.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.730
Who's Grimlock-san?

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.940
He was Griselda-san's husband.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.030
Of course, it was only an in-game marriage.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.950
<i>Griselda-san was a very powerful swordswoman.</i>

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.030
<i>She had both beauty and brains.</i>

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.830
<i>Grimlock-san was a kind person who always had a smile on his face.</i>

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.920
<i>They suited each other well and were a close couple.</i>

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.710
If Grimlock-san is the murderer from yesterday,

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:08.590
he must be targeting the three who wanted to use the ring.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:15.020
Caynz and I were part of the three who opposed the ring's sale.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.270
Then who's the last person?

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.860
A tank-class player called Schmitt.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.650
Nowadays, I hear he's a part of the Divine Dragon Alliance of the clearing group.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.240
Schmitt?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.030
I've heard of that name before...

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.200
He's the leader of the Divine Dragon Alliance's defenders.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.660
He's the large lance-wielder.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.790
Oh, him.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.960
You know Schmitt?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.380
Well, I've only seen him during boss fights.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.550
Could you arrange for the two of us to meet up?

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.800
He may not have heard of the incident yet.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.100
If so, he might end up meeting the same fate as Caynz...

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.930
Let's call Schmitt-san.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.230
I know someone in the Divine Dragon Alliance,

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.980
so if we go to their headquarters, I think I can organize a meeting.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.570
In that case, we should escort Yolko-san to an inn first.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:11.240
Yolko-san, be sure to stay inside the inn until we return.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.320
All right.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.250
So, how do you think the murder happened?

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.540
There are three possibilities at most.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.050
The first is the result of a fair duel.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:33.100
The second is the use of a complicated system exploit.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.760
Well, those two are givens.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.310
What's the third?

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.230
The use of an unknown skill that can disregard safe areas.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.310
Perhaps in the form of an item.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:46.360
On second thought, that's unlikely.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.190
Why?

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.110
Because it's unfair.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.610
I don't really want to admit it,

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:55.410
but SAO's rules are fundamentally fair.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:00.290
There's no way safe area murders would be encouraged like that.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.580
Oh...

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:14.220
Was the weapon that killed Caynz really made by Grimlock?

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.140
Yes.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.060
Why did Caynz get killed after all this time?!

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:21.980
Was he...

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.190
Was he the one that stole the ring?

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.980
Was he the one that killed Griselda?

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:32.570
Is Grimlock planning to kill us for not agreeing to sell the ring?

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.490
Are we being targeted, too?

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:40.330
Grimlock-san was the spear's maker, but someone else could have used it.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.670
Or maybe... Griselda-san is taking revenge.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.800
After all, killing in a safe area

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.130
can only be done by a ghost.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.350
I... stayed up last night thinking.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:04.060
In the end, all of the guild members share responsibility in Griselda-san's death!

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.940
After we got the ring, we shouldn't have voted,

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.780
and just let Griselda-san decide on what to do with it!

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.320
Only one person...

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.200
Grimlock-san alone thought Griselda-san should decide.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:27.210
That's why he has the right to avenge her...

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.380
by making us pay for her death with our lives.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.260
Don't screw with me...

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.930
This has to be some sick joke.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.180
After all this time...

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.640
Half a year's passed already, so why now?!

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.220
Are you just going to accept that, Yolko?

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.310
Are you fine with getting
mysteriously killed off like that?!

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.080
Yolko-san!

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:39.610
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:51.420
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.420 --> 00:23:03.220
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:13.820
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:24.870
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:37.460
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:44.260
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
