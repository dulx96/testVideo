WEBVTT

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.940
What're you blabbering on about?

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.980
You have that lizard to heal you,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.650
so what do you need healing crystals for?

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.030
Right back at you!

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.610
You fight from the safest position,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.160
so do you even need healing crystals?!

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.030
Of course I do.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.580
I'm not a cutesy little idol like you, Silica-chan,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.540
so the boys won't heal me.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.580
H-Hey, let's take it easy...

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.000
Fine.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.540
You can have them.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.960
I'll never party with you again.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.510
Party invitations practically fall into my lap, after all.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.010
W-Wait, Silica-chan!

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.110
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:02.040
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:10.840
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.140
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.390
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.110
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.240
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.700
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.830
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.500
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.340
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.510
I wanna always be with you.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.520
I'll give you everything I have.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.710
<i>I'm out of healing items!</i>

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.230
Pina!

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.280
Pina! Pina!

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.650
Pina...

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.910
Pina...

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.160
Pina...

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200
Pina!

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.790
Pina! Pina!

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.070
Pina...

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.370
Don't leave me alone...

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.200
Pina!

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.710
What's that feather?

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.170
It's Pina.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.420
My partner...

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.840
You're a beast tamer?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.300
Sorry.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.390
I didn't make it in time to save your friend.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.810
No...

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.730
It's because I was being reckless.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.810
I was in way over my head, thinking I could waltz out of here alone.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.910
Thank you very much... for saving me.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.000
Pina's Soul
Pina's Soul
Thank you very much... for saving me.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.530
Thank you very much... for saving me.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.780
Does that feather

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.700
have an item name or something?

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.830
Don't cry.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.670
As long as you have Pina's soul, it's still possible to resurrect her.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.170
Really?

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.130
Yes.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.800
In the southern part of the 47th Floor,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.220
there's a field dungeon called the Hill of Memories.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.680
I've heard that the flower at its
summit can resurrect a familiar.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.520
The 47th Floor...

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.780
If you reimbursed me, I'd get it for you, but...

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.990
Apparently, the flower only blooms in the presence of a beast tamer.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.030
The information alone is more than I could ask for.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.500
If I work hard to level up, someday I'll...

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.120
Familiars can only be revived within three days after their death.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.580
No way...

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.460
It's all my fault...

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.550
I'm sorry, Pina.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.420
Don't worry.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.430
Three days are plenty.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.140
These equips will provide a stat boost of at least five extra levels.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.230
If we go together, you should be able to manage.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.400
Why would you go so far for me?

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.030
If you promise not to laugh, I'll tell you.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.990
I promise.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.950
It's because...

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.950
you look like my sister.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.300
I'm sorry.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.470
Um, I'm sure the equipment's worth a lot more than I can afford, but...

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.510
No, don't worry about it.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.640
It's not like I'm going out of my way to help you, after all.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.730
Oh, my name is Silica.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.940
I'm Kirito.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.360
I hope we get along during our time together.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.620
Oh, it's Silica-chan!

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.830
You were in that forest all day.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.080
We were getting worried.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.000
U-Um—

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.370
Party with us next time.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.580
We can go wherever you want!

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.670
I appreciate the offer, but...

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.590
I've decided to party with this guy for a while.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.890
Sorry.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.430
I'm sorry for troubling you.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.640
Are they your fans?

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.480
You sure are popular.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.400
No...

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.150
I'm sure they only intend for me to be the party's mascot.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.070
But even though I realized that,

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.700
I got conceited when they started calling me Dragon Tamer Silica...

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.120
Don't worry about it.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.790
We'll definitely make it in time.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.670
Right.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.210
Where's your home?

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.880
It's on the 50th Floor, but...

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.970
it'll be easier if we stick together, so I think I'll spend the night here.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.100
Really?

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.010
The cheesecake here is pretty good, you know!

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.850
Well, if it isn't Silica?

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.400
Wow, you made it out of the forest?

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.610
Good for you.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.860
Something wrong?

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.400
No, it's nothing.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.070
Hm?

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.610
Where's the lizard?

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.990
Don't tell me it...

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.200
Pina died.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.740
But, I'll resurrect her, no matter what!

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.910
Oh?

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.370
So you're planning to go to the Hill of Memories?

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.210
Though, will you be able to reach it at your level?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.800
She will.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.670
It's not that dangerous of an area.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.800
Have you been seduced by her, too?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.680
From what I can see, you're not very strong.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.140
Let's go.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.560
Why is she so mean to me?

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.070
Is SAO the first MMO you've played?

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.110
Yes.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.820
Regardless of the game,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.200
many players act differently online.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.410
Amongst them, some choose to act as villains.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.080
See how our player indicators are green?

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.420
If you commit a crime, your indicator will turn orange.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.130
And the worst of that bunch are player killers.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:01.210
They're people who've committed murder and are known as "red players".

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.590
Murder?!

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.380
In a normal game,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.100
you could find entertainment in playing as a villain.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.970
However, Sword Art Online can't be treated the same way.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.190
This world <i>isn't all fun and games.</i>

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.440
Kirito-san...

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.900
Sorry.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.860
Ki-Kirito-san, you're a good person!

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.620
You're my savior!

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.000
Looks like our roles got switched.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.370
Thanks, Silica.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.920
Huh? I wonder why our cheesecake isn't here yet.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.880
Excuse me! We're still waiting for our dessert!

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.230
If I told him that I wanted to talk more,

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.890
would he laugh at me?

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.980
Silica, are you still awake?

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.860
Ki-Kirito-san?!

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.110
I forgot to tell you about the 47th Floor.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.280
Would tomorrow be better?

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.320
Now's fine.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.860
Your timing's actually perfe—

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.910
<i>That was close.</i>

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.830
Silica, something wrong?

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.250
No, don't mind me.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.170
Kirito-san, what's that?

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.380
It's called a Mirage Sphere.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.270
Beautiful!

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.480
This part is the 47th Floor's town area.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.860
And over here is the Hill of Memories.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.610
So this is the route we'll be taking...

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.730
Kirito—

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:47.650
Who's there?

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.200
What was that?

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.580
Someone was eavesdropping.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.370
B-But sounds are supposed to be inaudible across doors unless you knock...

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.750
It's a different story if you upgrade your Hearing skill.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.290
Not many would bother to do that though.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.630
Why would they eavesdrop on us?

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.350
This looks like some place from a fairytale!

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.190
This floor is known as the Flower Garden

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.480
because it's nearly covered by them.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.870
<i>Th-This place is...</i>

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.960
Silica?

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.630
Oh, yes!

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.670
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.300
You okay?

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.300
Oh, I'm just fine...

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.340
Let's go.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.640
Okay.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.720
This is...

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.980
If things get dangerous and I tell you run,

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:05.400
be sure to use this crystal to teleport away to a town.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.190
But...

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.570
Promise me.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.400
I understand.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.950
Then let's get going.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.870
If we follow this path, we'll reach the Hill of Memories.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.300
Um, Kirito-san...

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.220
Calm down, Silica!

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.430
This monster's just fodder!

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.310
Ki-Kirito-san, save me!

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.520
Save me with your eyes closed!

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.020
That would be... pretty tough.
Save me with your eyes closed!

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.690
Don't look!
That would be... pretty tough.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.440
Y-You pollen brain!

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.030
Enough already!

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.000
Did you see it?

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.210
Nope.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.170
Kirito-san,

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.180
would you mind telling me about your sister?

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.890
Why do you ask?

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.390
Remember how you told me I look like her?

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.600
I know it's impolite to ask about the real world...

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.150
Am I prying too much?

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.730
I said she's my little sister,

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.400
but she's actually my cousin.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.150
We've always lived together,

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.660
so I don't think she knows.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.070
Maybe that's why...

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.450
I've always distanced myself from her.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.160
Our grandfather is a strict man.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.460
When I was eight, he had us join a local kendo dojo,

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.090
but I quit after two years.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.760
My grandfather beat me for it.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.550
That's horrible...

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.010
Then, my sister defended me,

00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.100
telling him to stop because she'd
practice enough for the both of us.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.680
Since then, she trained hard

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.930
and even made it to the nationals.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.850
That's amazing.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.730
However, I've always felt guilty for it.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.570
She could have had other things she wanted to do

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.610
and cursed me for stealing her freedom.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.160
Perhaps saving you

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.370
was like an act of atonement.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.370
I'm sorry.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.630
I don't think your sister regrets her decision at all.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.000
It's impossible to work hard for something you don't enjoy.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.840
I'm sure she really loves kendo!

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.890
It's getting hard to tell who's helping whom.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.510
Maybe you're right.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.850
I hope so.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:47.520
All right!

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.600
I'll do my best, too!

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.320
Ki-Kirito-san!

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:01.490
Ow!

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.210
Is this where the flower is?

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.250
Yeah, should be.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.820
Take it.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.700
I can resurrect Pina with this, right?

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.750
Yeah.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.080
Thank goodness...

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.750
But there are a lot of strong
monsters lurking around here,

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.040
so let's wait until we're back in town.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.710
Pina would probably prefer that, too.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.010
Okay.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.470
Kirito-san?

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.100
Whoever's hiding back there,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.600
come out now.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.980
Ro-Rosalia-san?

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.360
If you're able to see through my Hiding skill,

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.820
your Detection skill must be quite advanced, Mr. Swordsman.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.700
Looks like you managed to get the Pneuma Flower.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.330
Congrats.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.410
Now... fork it over.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.580
Wh-Why should I do that?

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.000
Not on my watch, Rosalia-san.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.130
Or rather,

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:42.130
the leader of the orange guild, Titan's Hand.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.760
But her indicator's green!

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.760
It's a simple strategy.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.850
The green members find prey

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:54.100
and lead them into an ambush of orange players.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.480
The guy who eavesdropped on us yesterday was one of your men, right?

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.150
Then she partied with me for those two weeks because...

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.280
Exactly.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.160
I was assessing the strength of each party member

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.030
and waiting for them to accumulate more money.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.370
It was regrettable that you, my most anticipated prey, left the party.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.460
But then you told me that you were going after a rare item.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.130
Yet, despite knowing all of this, you still stuck with her.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.090
Are you retarded?

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:25.760
Or have you really been seduced by her?

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.970
No, I have an entirely different reason.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.850
I've actually been searching for you, Rosalia-san.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.060
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.110
You assaulted a guild called "Silver Flags" ten days ago, didn't you?

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.900
Four members were killed,
leaving only the leader alive.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.740
Oh, I remember those hobos.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:48.990
Their leader went to the plaza near the Teleport Gate at the front lines

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.580
and camped there all day and night, begging for someone to avenge his friends.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.830
But rather than wishing death upon your guild,

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.080
he only asked that you guys be thrown into prison.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.300
Can you understand how he must have felt?

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.010
Of course not.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.300
He sounds like an idiot for taking it so seriously.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.430
It's not like it's been proved that death here applies in the real world, too.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.060
Besides, you don't have the luxury to be worrying about others right now.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.990
Kirito-san, there are too many of them!

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.400
Let's get out of here!

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.660
Don't worry.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.580
Stand back and ready the crystal in case I tell you to run.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.330
Okay.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.040
B-But...

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:36.750
Kirito-san!

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.420
Kirito?

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.960
Black clothes...

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.960
A shieldless, one-handed sword user.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.750
He looks like...

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.760
the Black Swordsman.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.010
Rosalia-san, this guy's...

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.340
a beater that survives in the front lines, all by himself.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.550
He's part of the clearing group!

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.060
Clearing group?

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.890
There's no way someone from the clearing group would be here!

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:00.350
Come on, cut him down and loot his dead body!

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.650
Die!

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.080
I have to save him... Kirito-san...

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.000
What's going on?

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.670
What are you punks doing?!

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.300
Kill him already!

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.430
Around 400 damage every ten seconds, huh?

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:37.060
That's the damage output that the seven of you can muster.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.270
I'm Level 78.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.020
I have 14,500 HP.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.770
The health regeneration effect of my Battle Healing skill

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.820
restores 600 HP every ten seconds.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.150
You guys can hack at me all day and it wouldn't do a thing.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.280
Is that even possible?

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.160
It is.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.200
A mere increase in numbers can
create a ridiculous gap in strength.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.160
That's the unfair reality of an MMORPG leveling system.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.840
My client spent every penny he had to buy this.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.170
A teleport crystal.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.380
The teleport point's been set to the prison area.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.550
That's where you'll all be going!

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.010
Your indicator will turn orange if you attack me, a green play—

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.440
Remember, I'm a solo player.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.780
Having an orange indicator for a day or two means nothing to me.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.410
Sorry, Silica...

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.620
I ended up using you as bait.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.460
I thought you'd be scared if I was straight with you.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.050
You're a good person,

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.670
so I would've trusted you.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.890
Are you leaving now?

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.060
Yeah, I've been away from the front lines for five days now.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.350
I need to hurry back.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.940
Th-The clearing group is pretty amazing, huh?

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.070
No matter how many years I train, I'll never be able to join it.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.440
Um...

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.530
I...

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.530
Levels are nothing more than numbers.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:19.740
Strength in this world is just an illusion.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.040
There are more important things.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.130
Next time, let's meet in the real world.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.550
When we do, it'll be as friends, just like now.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.590
Right.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.340
I'm sure we will!

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.720
Now, let's resurrect Pina.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.810
Yeah!

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.610
<i>Pina...</i>

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:58.450
<i>I'll be sure to tell you lots and lots of stories, okay?</i>

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.870
<i>About my amazing adventure today...</i>

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:14.090
<i>And about the one day in my life that I had a big brother.</i>

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:39.660
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:51.460
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.460 --> 00:23:03.260
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:13.860
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:24.910
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:37.510
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:44.300
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
