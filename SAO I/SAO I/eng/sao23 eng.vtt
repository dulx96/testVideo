WEBVTT

00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.060
But...

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.020
If this was going to happen, it'd have
been better if you had stayed distant!

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.270
If you had...

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.780
I wouldn't have realized my feelings for you,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.530
or been pained by those feelings
after learning about Asuna-san...

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.790
I wouldn't have tried to forget about you
by falling in love with Kirito-kun, either!

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.670
I'm sorry.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.300
Just... leave me alone.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.900
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.320
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.880
Seeking but a miracle,
kiseki dake wo motome

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.050
I wander in the unrelenting darkness
kienai yami wo samayou

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:25.770
If I remain here, I'll only be trapped in the present.
doko ni ireba nidoto mirai miru koto dekinai

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.400
The moon beckons again tonight,
koyoi mo tsuki ga sasotte

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.110
and while I still can't voice my feelings,
mada kotoba dasenai kedo

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.900
I continue to scream inside my heart.
kokoro no naka sakebitsuzuketa

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.280
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.330
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.920
If only I could have become a little bit stronger,
ato honno sukoshi dake tsuyoku nareta nara

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.180
I would have flown far above these skies
me no mae ni aru kono sora koete yuku kara

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.270
and reached out to the future beyond here.
kono saki ni aru mirai ni te wo nobasu kara

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.870
<i>Ever since that time,</i>

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.000
<i>I couldn't really understand my
relationships, even within my family.</i>

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.380
<i>The fact that I wasn't actually a child of this family—</i>

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.930
<i>I realized this when I was ten.</i>

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.400
<i>"Who is she really?"</i>

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.610
<i>"Do I really know her?"</i>

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.160
<i>Maybe those unsettling feelings were one
of the reasons I turned to online games.</i>

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.580
<i>A fabricated world where nobody
truly knows one another.</i>

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.920
<i>I indulged in the comfort of that world.</i>

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.920
<i>But the two years I spent in SAO
allowed me to discover a single truth.</i>

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.430
<i>There's essentially no difference between
a real world and a virtual world.</i>

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.850
<i>It's pointless to question who someone really is.</i>

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.480
<i>All you can do is believe and accept.</i>

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.360
<i>Because the way you perceive
someone defines their true self.</i>

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.530
<i>When I returned to the real world,
I saw Sugu and was truly glad.</i>

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.830
<i>I swore to myself</i>

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.120
<i>that I would close the gap that had grown
between us over the past few years.</i>

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.130
<i>However, I...</i>

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.850
<i>What I can do for Sugu?</i>

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.600
Sugu.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.100
I'll be waiting for you at the northern terrace of Alne.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.620
Despite all of the horrible things I said...

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.620
You're so strong, Onii-chan.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.000
I can't be as strong as you.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.760
<i>Back then, I told you to keep trying,</i>

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.220
<i>that you can't give up.</i>

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.970
<i>But now...</i>I'm<i> the one that's crying.</i>

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.120
Still, what should I say...?

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.920
Leafa-chan!

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.840
Jeez, I've been looking everywhere for you, Leafa-chan.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.600
R-Recon?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.810
Weren't you held captive by the Salamanders?

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.560
I poisoned them all and escaped.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.980
Poisoned?

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.900
And then, I came looking for you.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.690
Wait...

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.860
So, where's that Spriggan?

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.150
Well...

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.950
You see, I said something terrible to him.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.830
Something I really shouldn't have.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.620
I'm such an idiot.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.880
Sorry if I weirded you out just now.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.800
I won't be seeing him anymore.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.010
Let's go back to Swilvane.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.600
Leafa-chan...

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.680
Leafa-chan!

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.980
Leafa-chan, you can't cry!

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.980
Wh-What?

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.150
The Leafa-chan I know should always be smiling!

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.940
I... I'll always be beside you!

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.530
Whether it's in the real world or
here, I'll never let you be alone!

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.950
Hey—

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.950
I-I... Leafa-chan...

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.330
Suguha-chan, I like you!

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.660
Um...

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.500
Wait! What do you think you're doing?!

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.590
A-Are you okay?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.590
That's weird.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:07.310
At this point, I thought it all depended on
whether or not I had the courage to confess.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.810
You're a real idiot, aren't you?

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.650
Maybe I should learn a thing or two from you.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.720
Hey.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.840
Sorry for the wait.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.390
Sugu—

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.560
Onii-chan, let's have a duel.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.310
To finish what we started.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.070
This time, there's no holding back.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.380
No wonder he looked so confident back then.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.710
Here I come!

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.610
Why?

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.200
How come?

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.660
I wanted to apologize to you,

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.410
but I didn't know what to say.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.920
So I thought I'd do so by letting you strike me.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.050
Really?

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.340
I'm sorry.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.010
Me, too.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:57.060
I haven't really returned from that world yet.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.110
It's still not over.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.780
Until she opens her eyes, that world is my reality.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.990
So...

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:11.120
I don't know what to think of you yet.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.450
I'll be waiting.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.080
For the time you finally come back home from that world.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.550
Until then, let me help you!

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.810
Um...

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.140
Wh-What's going on?

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.940
We're going to clear Yggdrasil.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.230
With the three of us: him, you, and me.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.150
I-I see.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.570
Wh-What?!

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.240
Yui, you there?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.490
What is it, Papa?

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.540
Did you figure anything out during
that fight with the guardians?

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:03.960
In terms of stats, they're not particularly
powerful, but their numbers are overwhelming.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.170
It's almost as if the area is designed
to be impossible to overcome.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.930
So together, they're practically
a massive, invincible boss, huh?

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:19.640
However, with Papa's skill proficiency, it may
be possible to break through momentarily.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.100
You guys,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.280
I'm sorry, but could you put up with
my selfishness one more time?

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.610
For some reason, it feels like
we're running out of time.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.830
If it's something I can do, you can count on me.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.330
And that goes for him, too.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.830
Well, Leafa-chan and I are one
in body and soul, after all.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.460
Don't get ahead of yourself!

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.300
I'm sorry.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.220
Let's do our best.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.400
Thanks, you two.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.740
I'll take on the guardians.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.490
Staying back and healing me
shouldn't make them target you.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.370
Let's go.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.630
Wow.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.000
But there are too many!

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.150
There's no end to them.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.160
Recon!

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:43.830
Right.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.670
Wh-Why are they targeting us?

00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:00.470
Their AI probably runs on different
algorithms than other monsters.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.100
In that case, it's meaningless to divide roles.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:07.940
Wait!

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.440
Recon?!

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:17.910
Leafa-chan, I don't really understand,
but this is important, right?

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.070
That's right.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.080
It's probably not just a game.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.790
Not now, that is.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.000
I'll do something about it!

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.420
R-Recon?

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.850
Y-You idiot!

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.560
Oh, no.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.790
Recon, that's enough. Run outside!

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.970
That's... dark magic.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.570
Self-destruction magic?

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.490
The death penalty for that is pretty serious...

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.870
You really <i>are</i> an idiot!

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.060
No way.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.940
No way... That's too much.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.740
This is...

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.610
This is just...

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.550
The Sylphs?

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.180
Why?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.600
Flying dragons?

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.940
The Cait Sith's dragoons?

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.950
Sorry we're late.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.570
Sorry!

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.280
It took some time to get our gear ready.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.290
Sakuya! Alicia!

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.630
Dragoons, breath attack at the ready!

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.760
Sylphs, subsequent attack at the ready!

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.840
Fire Breath...

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.930
Attack!

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.190
Fenrir Storm...

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.900
Fire!

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.240
Thank you!

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.990
Thanks to the both of you!

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.580
There's no need for thanks.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.450
We're indebted to that Spriggan, after all.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.790
And arming this raid party was only
possible with his huge donation.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.050
All units, charge!

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.230
Don't falter!

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.190
Push forth!

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.210
Sugu!

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.420
Watch my back!

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.680
Leave it to me.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.770
Follow their lead!

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.590
Onii-chan!

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.690
Go.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.320
Go, Onii-chan.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.450
Go!

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.880
All units, fall back!

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.630
We're withdrawing!

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.890
<i>Fly.</i>

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.350
<i>No matter the distance...</i>

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.360
<i>No matter the distance, soar through the skies...</i>

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.690
<i>to the core of this world.</i>

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.290
Damn it.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.660
What now?

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.130
Yui!

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.510
Yes, Papa?

00:20:55.050 --> 00:21:00.890
Papa, this door isn't locked by a quest flag.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.390
It's under the authority of system administrators.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:05.810
What do you mean?

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:10.320
In others words, this door was never
intended to be accessible to players!

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.630
<i>No, wait.</i>

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.130
<i>Wasn't that...</i>

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.340
Yui, use this.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.730
Transferring code...

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:05.870
We'll be teleported.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.330
Papa, your hand!

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:22.850
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:32.690
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.540
My endless feelings are lost
tomedonai omoi wa

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.130
in these ordinary days.
nichijou ni nomarete

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:58.300
They waver and change shape yet again.
yurameki nagara mata katachi wo kaeteitta

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.890
I wonder if I'm too late,
imasara mou osoi kana

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.350
but there's no answer in sight.
henji mo nai jimonjitou

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.350
Every decision is up to me,
subete wa sou jibun shidai

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.980
whether it's the beginning or the end.
owari mo hajimari mo

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.030
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands.
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:27.160
Flying towards the gentle light, I flap my wings.
yasashii hikari wo mezashite habatakuyo

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.250
I embrace the passion
kokoro ni tomoshita

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.460
that flared up in my heart
jounetsu mo daite

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:42.550
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
