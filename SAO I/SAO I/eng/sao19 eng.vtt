WEBVTT

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.820
I can see in here now!

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.910
Night vision magic, huh?

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.330
I guess Spriggans aren't completely useless.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.120
Wow. That kind of hurt my feelings.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.330
But it'd be good for you to
memorize the spells you have.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.500
Illusion magic's all you'll really be good at though.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Illusion?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.420
You can cause others to see things.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.340
Too bad it's not very useful in combat.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.180
Well, it's not like it's set in stone that lame
Spriggan magic can't be of any use in battle.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.020
Damn, there goes my self-confidence.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.900
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.320
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.880
Seeking but a miracle,
kiseki dake wo motome

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.050
I wander in the unrelenting darkness
kienai yami wo samayou

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:28.770
If I remain here, I'll only be trapped in the present.
doko ni ireba nidoto mirai miru koto dekinai

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.400
The moon beckons again tonight,
koyoi mo tsuki ga sasotte

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.110
and while I still can't voice my feelings,
mada kotoba dasenai kedo

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.910
I continue to scream inside my heart.
kokoro no naka sakebitsuzuketa

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.290
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.330
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.920
If only I could have become a little bit stronger,
ato honno sukoshi dake tsuyoku nareta nara

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.180
I would have flown far above these skies
me no mae ni aru kono sora koete yuku kara

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.270
and reached out to the future beyond here.
kono saki ni aru mirai ni te wo nobasu kara

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.540
Instead of cramming the incantations into your head,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.790
try memorizing the meanings behind the words of power,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.960
so you can remember the spells by their effects.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.590
I didn't expect I'd be doing something that reminds me of English class in a game.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.720
Just so you know, high-level spells are around twenty words long.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.640
I'd much rather just be a pure fighter then.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.640
Quit whining.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.560
Oh, I got a message.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.350
Sorry, give me a second.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.980
Sure.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.360
Recon, again?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.940
It's probably nothing important though.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.570
"As I thought, my suspicions
were spot-on. Be careful, s"...

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.870
What is this?

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.660
"S"?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.040
Sa... Shi... Su... Huh?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.040
What's wrong?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.370
Well, the thing is—

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.920
Papa, there's something approaching us.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.290
Monsters?

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.590
No, they're players.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.510
And a lot of them. Twelve in total.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.220
Twelve?!

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.590
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.220
Let's hide until they pass by.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.760
But where?

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.730
Well, just leave it to me.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.650
H-Hey...

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.320
If you need to say something, try to do so quietly.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.620
The magic will be dispelled if we're too loud.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.540
Gotcha.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.290
They'll be in view soon.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.090
What's... that?

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.340
Huh? You shouldn't be able to see them yet.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.800
It's not a player. A bat, maybe?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.180
I see something small and red.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.270
H-Hey, what are you doing?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.480
That's a high-level Tracing Searcher!

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.940
I have to get rid of it!

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.620
We're running for it, Kirito-kun!

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.580
Is hiding again not an option?

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.880
The enemy will have already
noticed that the Tracer's gone,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.840
so they'll know we're onto them.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.260
Besides, that thing was a fire-attribute familiar.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.550
Which means the members of the party chasing us are...

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.970
Salamanders, huh?

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.940
But what's a group of them doing here?

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.600
Wow, it's a lake.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.690
Looks like we're in the clear.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.660
Don't get too excited and trip!

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.990
Shoot.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.880
That won't work.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.170
Should've told me sooner.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.470
You're too hasty.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.140
This is an earth magic barrier, so it can't be destroyed by physical attacks.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.310
Can we jump into the lake?

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.060
Nope.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.770
There's supposedly an ultra-high level
water dragon-type monster lurking in it.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.900
It would be suicidal to try and fight it
underwater without support from Undines.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.780
So our only option is to fight, huh?

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.110
Well yes, but we might be in over our heads.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.410
If Salamanders are using such high-level earth magic,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.620
that means one of them is a considerably skilled mage.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.290
Leafa, it's not that I don't have faith in your sword skills,

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.050
but could you stick to just supporting me?

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.590
Stay back and focus on healing me.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.340
That way, I'll be able to concentrate on fighting.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.950
<i>They came prepared to fight Kirito-kun!</i>

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.550
Kirito-kun!

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.340
<i>At this rate, it's just a matter of time before his HP runs out.</i>

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.720
That's enough, Kirito-kun!

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.760
It'll only take a few hours to fly back here if they kill us!

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.140
Let's call it quits now!

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.930
Never.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.560
I'll never let anyone in my party die as long as I'm standing.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.650
That's the last thing I'd let happen!

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.210
Damn! What's with this guy?!

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.460
This is our only chance!

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.470
Chance?

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.970
Please use all the mana you have left to block the next magic attack somehow!

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.430
B-But what would that do?

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.550
Papa, now!

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.140
<i>That incantation is for an illusion-type spell.</i>

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.640
<i>But all it's gonna do is make him look like a monster.</i>

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.660
Is that you, Kirito-kun?

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.100
Fools!

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.890
Maintain the formation!

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.220
Only his form and reach were changed!

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.100
If we stick to the plan and stay in formation, there's nothing to worry about!

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.740
C-Cast explosion magic!

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.690
R-Retreat...

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.270
Retreat!

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.130
Please stop!

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.680
Kirito-kun, spare that one's life!

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.190
Quite the show, huh?

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.770
O-Ouch...

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.570
Now, tell me whose idea it was to attack us.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.530
G-Go ahead and kill me!

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.570
Why you...

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.990
Man, I really went all out.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.660
Hey, nice fight!

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.790
That was a great strategy.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.750
If I was alone, I'd have been a goner.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.500
Wh-What, Kirito-kun?

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.300
Leave this to me.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.300
So, I'd like to make a deal with you.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.470
These are the items and Yrd that I got from your friends.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.270
If you answer my questions, I might give them all to you.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.400
Seriously?

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.020
Absolutely.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.360
Men.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.160
They're such simple-minded creatures.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.660
I think it was in the evening when Jitax-san—

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.960
Um, he's the leader of that mage unit earlier.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.580
He sent me a text asking me to get online.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.590
When I did, I found out he was planning to hunt a couple of players with more than ten people.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.710
I thought it was just bullying,

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.680
but when I heard that they were the people who beat Kagemune-san, it made sense.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.850
Who's Kagemune?

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.680
The captain of the lance unit.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.680
He's an expert at hunting Sylphs, you see.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.520
But yesterday, I saw him running back from a hunt with his team wiped out.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.400
You're the one that beat him, right?

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.530
So why did Jitax-san target us?

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.030
It seemed like he had orders from the higher-ups.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.660
Something about you guys interfering with our plans.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.490
What plans?

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.410
They don't tell anything to underlings like me,

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.040
but it seems like it was something big.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:10.050
When I logged on today, I saw a massive army flying north.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.630
North?

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.090
Are they aiming to clear Yggdrasil?

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.430
Of course not.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:21.640
We're trying to save enough to get every soldier ancient-weapon-grade equipment or better first.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.190
That's everything I know.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.230
Are you going to keep your end of the bargain?

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.860
Yeah, I'd never lie about a trade.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:38.620
Say, that rampaging monster from earlier was you, right?

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.160
Probably.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.410
Probably?

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.080
This happens to me sometimes.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.630
I go berserk during a battle and
forget what happened afterward.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.340
Whoa, scary.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.380
Well, I sort of remember what happened earlier.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.840
When I used magic as Yui told me to...

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.760
<i>Now!</i>

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.510
I grew ridiculously large.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.640
My sword was gone, so I had to use my hands.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.640
You were snacking on some of them too.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.400
Yeah, that reminds me...

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.690
It was a pretty fun experience getting to see what it's like to be a monster.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.450
So... could you even taste them?

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.700
They had the flavor and texture of well-grilled beef.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.580
On second thought, forget it. I don't want to know.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.090
Wow...

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.390
So this is Lugrue, huh?

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.140
O-Ouch...

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.260
You were asking for that one, Papa.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.310
I'll say!

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:50.020
I was trying to lighten up the mood with a joke after all that chaos.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.480
Try that again and <i>you'll</i> be well-grilled beef.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.440
Y-Yes'm.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.080
Oh, right.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.700
Didn't you get a message before we
were attacked by those Salamanders?

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.750
Oh, I forgot about that.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.130
Come on, Recon...

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.670
Maybe he went to sleep.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.090
Why don't you try contacting him in the real world?

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.930
Well then, I'll log off for a bit and check.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.930
Just wait for me here.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.180
Take care of my avatar, Yui-chan.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:26.640
Huh?

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.390
Keep an eye on Papa so he doesn't try any more funny business.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.020
Roger that!

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.480
Seriously...

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.050
Hello, Nagata-kun?

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.760
What on Earth's going on?

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.470
You finally picked up!

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.220
Jeez, it took you long enough, Suguha-chan!

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.390
I ran into some trouble in-game.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.150
I-It's terrible!

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.900
That jerk Sigurd is after us.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.270
A-And that's not all.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.610
He sold out our leader, Sakuya-san!

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.570
Sold out?

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.110
What do you mean?

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.780
Tell me the whole story.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.990
But there's no time.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.620
Well, you know...

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.750
Yesterday, when we were attacked by Salamanders in the Elder Forest area...

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.130
Suguha-chan, didn't it seem strange to you?

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.880
Strange? What about it?

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.340
Sigurd said he'd be a decoy and lured three of them away, remember?

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.880
Oh yeah, that's right.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.510
That's not something Sigurd would do.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.350
Wouldn't he normally make someone else do it?

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.390
Yeah, that's true.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.150
But what are you getting at?

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.690
Well, you see...

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.820
He was actually working together with them!

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.400
Odds are, he has been for a while!

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.490
Huh? Do you have any proof to back that up?

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.200
I... had a feeling something was wrong,

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.870
so I used invisibility magic to follow Sigurd around since morning.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:20.170
Then, in a back alley, he and his men put on invisibility cloaks and disappeared,

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.470
so I was positive that he was really up to something.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.890
There were two strange men waiting for them deep inside the sewers.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.730
Then I realized that they were Salamanders!

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.060
I knew I'd discovered something big, so I listened in,

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.650
and I heard them say that the Salamanders had a Tracer following you.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.700
So what happened to you?

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.370
I'm still in the sewers, paralyzed by a poison arrow.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.460
The Salamanders captured me.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.840
So that's why you called me in the real world.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.670
And he's not just dealing with them!

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:09.470
The thing is, Sakuya-san is signing an
alliance treaty with the Cait Siths today,

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.010
so she supposedly snuck off to a neutral region.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.400
Sigurd plans to march a massive army of
Salamanders straight to the signing ceremony!

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.940
I have to go!

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.320
Welcome back, Leafa.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.860
Welcome back.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.120
Kirito-kun, I have to apologize.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.870
There's something I have to go do right now.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.670
I don't really have time to explain,

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:43.000
and I probably won't be able to come back here either.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.420
Then I'll hear you out while we're moving.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.180
Either way, we can only leave here by foot, right?

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.350
All right.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.110
So, in forty minutes, at an area near Butterfly Valley,

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.740
the Sylph and Cait Sith leaders will have a conference.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.110
I see.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.780
Mind if I ask a few questions?

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:11.700
Go ahead.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.660
How would the Salamanders benefit from attacking the Sylph and Cait Sith leaders?

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.290
First, they'd be able to prevent the alliance.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:25.420
The Cait Siths wouldn't stand for having their leader taken down because the Sylphs leaked information.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.300
I bet.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.430
At worst, it would start a war
between Sylphs and Cait Siths.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:36.890
Also, if they kill the leader, they'd
receive thirty percent of her estate

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.770
and be allowed to occupy and tax the capital for ten days.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.850
That's a high price to pay.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.360
With that being said, Kirito-kun...

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.690
This is a Sylph problem,

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.780
so there's no reason for you to come along with me.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.830
We probably won't even be able to get back here alive,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.250
which means we'd have to travel from Swilvane again.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.710
No, if anything...

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:08.380
If you want to get to the top of Yggdrasil, it might be best for you to side with the Salamanders.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:16.260
Assuming the Salamanders succeed, they'd be in the perfect position to challenge Yggdrasil.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.020
Since you're a Spriggan, they
might hire you as a mercenary.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:25.940
So, even if you were to kill me now, I wouldn't blame you.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.320
After all, it's just a game, so anything goes.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.120
Kill if you want to kill, and steal if you want to steal.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.910
I've met far more people who thought like that than I would've liked.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.540
And it's true in a sense.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.380
I used to think like that too.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.340
But now I know better.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.630
It's <i>because</i> it's a virtual world that
there are things we have to protect.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.550
Someone very dear to me taught me that.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:04.810
If you let your desires control you in this world, it'll change you even in the real world.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.060
A player and their character are one and the same.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.860
I like you, Leafa.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.280
I want to be your friend.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:19.790
And no matter the reason,
 I would never kill such a person

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.290
for my own benefit.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.670
Kirito-kun...

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.720
Thank you.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.550
Sorry if I sounded condescending. It's a bad habit of mine.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.390
No, I was happy to hear that.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:43.890
Oh, shoot!

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.730
I just wasted our time, didn't I?

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.730
Yui, we're gonna run, so navigate for us!

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.560
Leave it to me!

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.820
Give me your hand.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.650
U-Um...

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.240
Here we go!

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.990
H-Hey... there are monsters!

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.460
There's the exit!

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:22.850
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:32.690
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.540
My endless feelings are lost
tomedonai omoi wa

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.130
in these ordinary days.
nichijou ni nomarete

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:58.300
They waver and change shape yet again.
yurameki nagara mata katachi wo kaeteitta

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.890
I wonder if I'm too late,
imasara mou osoi kana

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.350
but there's no answer in sight.
henji mo nai jimonjitou

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.350
Every decision is up to me,
subete wa sou jibun shidai

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.980
whether it's the beginning or the end.
owari mo hajimari mo

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.030
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands.
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:27.160
Flying towards the gentle light, I flap my wings.
yasashii hikari wo mezashite habatakuyo

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.250
I embrace the passion
kokoro ni tomoshita

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.460
that flared up in my heart
jounetsu mo daite

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:42.550
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
