WEBVTT

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.680
Kirito-kun,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.020
if you still insist, win her with your sword—your dual wielding.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.900
If you defeat me in a duel, we will relinquish Asuna-kun to you.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.110
But should you lose, you must join the Knights of the Blood.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.990
Very well.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.120
If you want to let our swords do the talking, I have no problems with that.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.370
Let's settle this with a duel.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.340
Hurry, the good seats are almost sold out!

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.840
Jeez, you stupid, reckless idiot!

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.300
Why did you accept his challenge?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.680
Sorry! I'm sorry.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.600
I just took his bait without thinking.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.770
When I saw your Dual Wielding before, I thought
your strength was on a completely different level.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.070
But even so, the commander's
Unique Skill is no less amazing.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.820
Well, I've seen it first-hand several times.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.900
The technique that boasts both attack and defense,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.820
Sacred Sword.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.990
His offensive power is high, but it's his defense that's particularly astounding.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.330
There isn't a soul that's seen the
commander's HP drop to the yellow zone.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.380
That invincibility practically breaks the game's balance.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.750
I know.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.260
What are you gonna do?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.640
If you lose, then forget my leave, you'll be forced to join the Knights of the Blood.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.930
Well, I don't plan to go down without a fight.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.070
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:48.000
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.800
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.100
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.350
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.070
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.200
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.660
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.790
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.460
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.300
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.470
I wanna always be with you.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.480
I'll give you everything I have.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.120
My apologies, Kirito-kun.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.450
I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.120
I'll be taking a cut of the earnings.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.040
No.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.590
After our match, you'll be a member of our guild.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.920
I'll have you consider this to be a mission.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.500
<i>His shield?!</i>

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.930
Your reaction time is impressive.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.440
And your defense is practically impenetrable.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.940
Wow! Go get 'em!

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.950
<i>I'm not done yet.</i>

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.620
<i>I can go even faster!</i>

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.760
Kirito-kun...

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.020
<i>He's open!</i>

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.910
<i>What?! </i>

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.690
D-Didn't I ask for a plain-looking outfit?

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.360
That's one of the simplest outfits we have.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.530
Yep, you look great in it.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.620
A guild, huh?

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.410
Looks like I got you dragged into all this.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.120
Well, it may have been time.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.250
I was about to hit the limits of solo play anyways.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.130
If that's how you see it, I'm glad.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.340
Say, Kirito-kun.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.800
Can you tell me something?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.310
Why do you avoid guilds—and people?

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.400
It's not just because you're a beta tester or possess a Unique Skill, right?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.060
You're a kind person, after all.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.860
It was a long time ago.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.240
Over a year ago, I think.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.240
I used to be in a guild.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.330
Myself included, it was just a small group of six.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.960
We were called the Black Cats of the Full Moon.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.920
The truth is, their levels were far below mine.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.970
When they invited me, I thought they would've retracted their offer if I told them my level.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.810
So I lied about it and joined their guild.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.400
Back then, the homey atmosphere around them became something I longed for.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.070
But one day...

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.620
I'm responsible for all of their deaths.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:34.000
If I hadn't hid the fact that I was a beater,
they would have heeded my warning about the traps.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.460
The one who killed them all, including Sachi, was me.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.780
I won't die.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.740
After all, I'm the one who's protecting you.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.550
Training?

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.930
That's right.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:32.390
You'll be joining me in forming a party of three in order to clear the dungeon on this floor.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.980
Wait, Godfree.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.270
Kirito-kun is with me—

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.400
Even if you're the vice commander, it'd be problematic for you to ignore regulations.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:47.370
And besides, he's a new member, so as forward commander, I need to see the extent of his abilities.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.620
S-Someone of your level would be a pushover for Kirito-kun!

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.750
Well then, in half an hour, we'll
assemble at the town's west gate!

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.380
Just when I thought we finally had some alone time...

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.760
I'll be back before you know it.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.060
Wait here while I'm gone.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.180
Okay.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.430
Take care.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.320
Hey, over here!

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.490
What's the meaning of this?

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.660
Oh, now that you've become one of our comrades,

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.540
I thought it'd be good to make the past water under the bridge.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.550
I apologize for the trouble I caused you the other day.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.510
It won't happen ever again, so please forgive me.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.430
S-Sure.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.020
There, problem solved.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.110
Now then, today I'd like to see how you
handle yourselves in the face of a crisis,

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.860
so I'll be holding onto all of your crystals.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.360
Even our teleport crystals?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.400
Yep.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.540
Fine.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.460
Great!

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.670
Now, off we go, men!

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.170
Yeah...

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.520
Okay, we'll take a break here.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.440
I'll hand out rations now.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.270
<i>Paralytic poison!</i>

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.330
Wh-What's the meaning of this?

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.870
The one who provided the water...

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.660
Kuradeel, don't tell me...

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.960
Hurry, the antidote crystals!

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.970
Godfree-san.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:55.720
I knew you were pretty dimwitted,
but it looks like you're a total meathead!

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.730
Wh-What are you doing?

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.070
S-Stop it!

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.780
Listen up.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.910
Our party was...

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.410
in a field when it was assaulted by a large group of criminal players!

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.710
Two of us fell, fighting bravely in vain!

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:29.710
Although I was the last one standing, I succeeded in repelling the criminals and returned safely!

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.870
Hey.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:10.210
Just because of a brat like you, I ended up having to kill an innocent person.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.220
Despite killing him with a smile on your face?

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.050
Why would someone like you join the Knights of the Blood?

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.180
A criminal guild would've been a much better fit!

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.560
Interesting of you to say that.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.520
You've got good eyes.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.480
That's the PK guild, Laughing Coffin!

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.320
I picked up how to make the paralysis poison there.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.490
Oh, I'm getting sidetracked.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.580
If I don't end the chatter here, the poison will wear off.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.830
How about we go straight to the end?

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.670
<i>The poison still isn't wearing off?</i>

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.300
Well, how does it feel?!

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.140
What's it like being on the brink of death?

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.940
Come on, feel free to share!

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.150
<i>Am I...</i>

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.490
<i>Am I going to die like this?</i>

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.410
Hey, come on!

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.950
Say something!

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.370
You're really gonna die!

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.020
Oh, what's this?

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.980
So you <i>are afraid of dying.</i>

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.520
That's right.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.190
I can't... die just yet!

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.490
Really?

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.450
That's how it's gotta be!

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.040
Die! Die!

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.170
Die!

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.690
Heal!

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.940
I made it...

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.530
I made it!

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.650
Thank God... I made it.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.370
While I was monitoring your location on the map,

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.250
Godfree's marker disappeared,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.210
so I thought something must've happened...

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.840
You're alive...

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.380
You're alive, aren't you, Kirito-kun?

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.550
Yeah, I am.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.180
Wait here.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.890
I'll finish this quickly.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.770
A-Asuna-sama, this is just training.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.400
Yes, we had a small accident while training—

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:19.740
Damn!

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.660
O-Okay, I understand!

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.330
I'm sorry!

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.460
I'll leave the guild!

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.590
I'll never appear before you ever again!

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:39.800
So please!

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.760
I don't want to die!

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.270
You're too naïve, Vice Commander!

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.420
You damn murderer.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.640
I'm sorry.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.650
This...

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.190
This is all my fault, isn't it?

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.910
Asuna...

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.160
I'm sorry.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.660
I... w-won't...

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.870
bother you...

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.340
ever again.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.690
My life is yours, Asuna.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.070
So I'll live for your sake.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.070
Until the very end, let's be together!

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.360
Likewise...

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.450
I'll protect you, no matter what.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.200
From now until all of eternity.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.410
So...

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.960
Regardless of what may come, I will send you back...

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.460
to the real world.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.960
Asuna.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.170
Today...

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.260
Tonight, I want to be with you.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.490
Okay.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.140
S-Stop staring.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.690
Ki-Kirito-kun, hurry up and take off your clothes.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.820
It's too embarrassing if I'm the only one undressed.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.660
No, wait!

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.410
I only...

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.990
intended to stay in the same room with you for the night.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.660
I wasn't suggesting... anything.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.090
Y-Y-You...

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.310
jerk!

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.660
Sorry, did I wake you up?

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.990
Yeah.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.500
I dreamed a little.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.170
About the real world.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.960
It's weird.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:53.840
I dreamed about what would happen if my experiences
with you and in Aincrad were all just a dream.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.930
I was really scared.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.600
Thank goodness... this isn't a dream.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.720
That's silly.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.480
You don't want to go back?

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.890
I do.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.980
I do, but I don't want the time we spent here to disappear.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.490
To me, these two years are precious.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.450
This is how I really feel.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.700
Say, Kirito-kun.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.750
Do you think we could stay away from the front lines for a while?

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.250
For some reason, I'm scared.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:32.380
I have a feeling that if we head straight back, something terrible will happen again.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.630
Maybe I'm just a little tired.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.390
You're right.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.850
I'm kinda tired too.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:49.900
In the southwest area of the 22nd Floor, there's a small village surrounded by forestry and a lake.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.980
Let's move there together.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.280
And then...

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.200
And then?

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.160
Let's...

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.120
Let's get married.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.670
Okay!

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:39.740
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:51.540
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.540 --> 00:23:03.350
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:13.940
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:24.990
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:37.590
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:44.390
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
