WEBVTT

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.400
Ready?

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.190
Here we go.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.580
There's nothing in here...

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.120
Wait.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.870
It'll be fine as long as I don't go too far.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.000
Besides, if we don't even see the boss,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.670
we won't be able to strategize how to beat it.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.510
I know, but...

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.130
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.050
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:25.850
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.150
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.410
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.120
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.250
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.720
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.840
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.520
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.360
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.530
I wanna always be with you.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.530
I'll give you everything I have.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.300
We're going to have a tough time beating that.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.800
Yeah.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.680
From a glance, its only weapon is a large sword, but it probably has special abilities too.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.350
Our best bet would be to gather strong vanguards and switch frequently.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.980
I'd suggest gathering at least ten shield wielders.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.150
Shield wielders, huh?

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.230
Wh-What is it?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.980
You're hiding something, aren't you?

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.570
Where'd that come from?

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.700
I mean, it's strange.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.910
The greatest merit of using a one-handed sword is being able to use a shield, isn't it?

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.160
However, I've never seen you using a shield even once.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.960
In my case, the speed of my rapier would drop,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.170
and some people don't use them because of their fashion sense.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.840
You haven't been using the sword Lis made either.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.090
<i>Very suspicious...</i>

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.690
Well, whatever.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.770
Asking about your skills would be impolite of me.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.440
Anyways, it's gotten pretty late, so let's have lunch.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.360
What?!

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.360
I-Is it handmade?

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.160
Yep.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.200
Make sure to take off your gloves before eating.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.830
O-Okay.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.500
Here, help yourself.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.710
Delicious!

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.630
But really, what's this flavor?

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.180
It's the result of a year of
training and experimentation.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.810
I made this by figuring out the interactions

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.810
between the hundred or so flavorings in Aincrad,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.900
and analyzing their effects on the taste simulation engine's parameters.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.610
This is a mix of Grogwa Seed,
Shubul Leaf, and Carim Water.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.610
It tastes like mayonnaise.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.780
And this one's Abilpa Bean, Sag Leaf, and Oorafish Bones.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.790
Th-This nostalgic taste is...

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Soy sauce!

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.250
I made the sandwich's sauce with that.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.630
Amazing. It's perfect!

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.050
If you sold this, you could make a fortune!

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.130
Y-You think so?

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.970
Actually, never mind that.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.430
Wh-Why?

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.890
I'd hate for my portion to be sold off.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.860
Thinking with your stomach? Jeez...

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.740
If I feel like it, I'll make it for you again.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.540
Oh man, I'm beat.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.740
Let's take a break.
Oh man, I'm beat.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.290
We finally made it.
Let's take a break.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.540
Sounds good.
We finally made it.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.410
How about ov—
Sounds good.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.750
How about ov—

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.330
Oh, if it ain't Kirito!

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.380
It's been a while!

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.460
So you're still alive, Klein?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.260
I see you're bad with words as usual.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.430
Huh?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.720
What's going on?

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.140
Why's a solo player like you with a girl—

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.600
H-Huh?

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.690
Um... I'm sure you know each other from the boss fights, but I'll introduce you anyways.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.520
He's Klein from the guild, Fuurinkazan.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.780
And she's Asuna from the Knights of the Blood.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.530
Hey, say something.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.070
Are you lagging?

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.080
G-G-Good afternoon! K-Klein, 24 years old, single, looking for a girlfr—

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.960
Leader!

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.970
A-Aren't you Asuna-san?!

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.850
I've always wanted to meet you!

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.930
Hey, quit pushing.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.360
W-Well, they're not bad guys, so aside from their leader's face...

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.900
You...

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.530
Call it payback.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.200
K-Klein!

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.490
What about my face? You little...

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.080
So what's going on, Kirito?

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.870
Uh, well...

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.330
Good afternoon.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.750
I'm just partying with him for a while. Nice to meet you.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.500
Kirito, you!

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.090
Wait, let me explain.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.220
Kirito-kun.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.930
They're...

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.640
Members of the Army?

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.690
What's the giant, reigning guild of the 1st Floor doing here?

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.270
Ever since they suffered major losses while clearing the 25th Floor,

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.990
they began to prioritize strengthening their organization over clearing,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.070
and stopped coming to the front lines.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.330
At ease!

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.750
I am Lt. Colonel Kovats of the Aincrad Liberation Army.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.090
I'm Kirito, a solo player.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.720
Have you lot already cleared the area beyond here too?

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.760
Yeah, we've mapped up to the boss room.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.390
Well then, I'd like you to provide us with that map data.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.600
You want it for free?!

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.860
Are you saying that knowing how tough mapping is?!

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.360
We distribute information and resources equally to all players

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.450
and maintain order amongst the people.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.330
In regards to freeing everyone from this world,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.500
we unceasingly fight to make it happen as soon as possible!

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.630
And thus, it's naturally your duty to cooperate with us!

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.460
You know...

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.800
Damn bloke...

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.880
Calm down.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.470
We were planning to distribute the data freely once we got back to town anyways.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.510
I don't mind.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.720
Hey, come on.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.810
That's being a bit too nice, Kirito.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.060
I have no intention of profiting off of map data.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.020
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.200
If you're planning on fighting the boss, you'd better not.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.780
I will be the one to decide that.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.910
We took a look inside the boss room earlier

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.790
and it's not an enemy you can take on with those numbers!

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.040
Besides, your troops aren't looking so well.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.840
My men are not so weak that they'd give up so readily!

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.300
All of you! On your feet at once!

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.520
Are they gonna be okay?

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.640
Those guys...

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.980
At any rate, I doubt they'll head straight to the boss.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.650
How about we at least keep an eye on them?

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.950
I wonder who's the nice guy here.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.580
Let's get moving.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.920
Uh... Um...

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.750
Asuna-san.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.630
Uh, the thing is...

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.880
he's bad with words, often awkward,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.970
and not to mention, obsessed with fighting.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.850
Regardless, please look after Kirito.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.060
Got it.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.110
I'll take good care of him.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.950
The only thing past here is the boss room, right?

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.370
Maybe they already went back using their items?

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.090
Asuna!

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.840
Yeah.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.340
Hey!

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.180
Idiots!

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.100
Hey, you guys okay?!

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.160
What are you doing?!

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.660
Use your teleport crystals already!

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.910
We can't!

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.120
Th-The crystals won't work!

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.460
But the previous boss rooms never trapped players like that...

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.920
Those of us in the Liberation Army shall never retreat!

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.380
Fight! With all your might!

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.930
That idiot...

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.720
Hey, what's going on?

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.060
Teleport crystals don't work in there.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.560
If we raid the room, we might be able to let them escape, but...

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.230
Isn't there something they can do?

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:32.280
All of you! Charge!

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.160
Stop!

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.140
Hey,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.680
get a hold of yourself!

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.230
Impossible...

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.820
No way...

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.420
No...

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.130
Just no...

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.340
Anymore is...

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.180
No!

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.640
Asuna!

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.760
Don't blame me for what happens!

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.660
Get back!

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.830
You okay?

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.130
Thanks.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.270
<i>At this rate...</i>

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.110
Kirito-kun!

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.110
Kirito!

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.280
<i>Is that the only option left?</i>

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.160
<i>But...</i>

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.930
<i>Damn it. This isn't the time to think!</i>

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.020
Asuna! Klein!

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.100
Please, keep it occupied for just ten seconds!

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.060
O-Okay!

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.240
All right, I'm good!

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.040
Switch!

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.650
Starburst...

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.320
Stream.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.740
Wh-What the hell is that skill?

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:06.700
<i>Faster.</i>

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.050
<i>Even faster!</i>

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.830
Is it...

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.580
...over?

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.030
<i>Kirito-kun!</i>

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.110
<i>Come on, Kirito-kun!</i>

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.540
Ouch...

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.760
How long was I out for?

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.340
Only a few seconds.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.510
You idiot!

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.590
That was reckless.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:52.140
If you hold me too tightly, my HP will get depleted.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.900
Kovats and two other men died.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.030
This is the first time there've been casualties during a boss raid since the 67th Floor.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.700
Could you even call it a raid?

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.910
Kovats, that numbskull...

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.580
If you die, there's no point to it all.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.220
That aside, what was that earlier?

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.220
Do I have to tell?

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.050
Of course!

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.930
I've never seen anything like it!

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.600
It's the Extra Skill:

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.520
Dual Wielding.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.270
What're the conditions to obtain it?

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.610
If I knew, I'd have told everyone.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.650
It's not even on the information brokers' list.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.490
Which means it's exclusive to you...

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.620
It's a Unique Skill.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.950
Jeez, that's not fair, Kirito.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.000
How could you keep such an amazing skill a secret?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.130
Around six months ago, when I opened my skill window, I found the Dual Wielding Skill there.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.760
But, if it became known that I had such a skill...

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.840
Net gamers are prone to jealousy, after all.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.180
I'm a good guy, so me aside,

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.680
it wouldn't be unlikely for people to envy you.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.140
Besides...

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:23.570
Well, think of that hardship as a part of life and keep on fighting, young one.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.320
It's not like that.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.870
All right, you wanna go and activate the Teleport Gate?

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.410
No, I'll leave it to you.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.410
I can't even move a finger right now.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.830
I see.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.330
Be careful on your way back.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.550
Um... Kirito.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.970
When you ran in to save the Army guys...

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.310
What about it?

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.810
I... How should I put this...

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.730
I was glad.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.770
That's all.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:01.730
See you later!

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.490
Hey, Asuna.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.410
I was scared.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.000
I don't know what I'd do if you died.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.250
What are you saying?

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.880
You're the one who ran in first.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.920
I'm going to take a leave from my guild for a while.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.510
T-Take a leave for what?

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.930
Did you already forget that I said I'd party with you, Kirito-kun?

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.250
All right.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.980
The Army's great warriors were annihilated by a blue demon.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.940
And the one who single-handedly defeated it was a dual-wielder utilizing a 50-hit combo.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.780
This really got blown out of proportions.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.870
There's a limit to how much a story can be embellished.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.490
Because of that, I've been stalked by
swordsmen and information brokers all day,

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.250
so I can't even stay in my room anymore.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.290
Aren't you just reaping what you sowed?

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.300
Since you spilled the beans despite saying it's our little secret.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.180
What should we do?

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.510
Kirito-kun!

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.180
This is terrible!

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.100
I believe this is our first time meeting outside of a boss fight,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.610
isn't it, Kirito-kun?

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:13.740
No, we spoke before during the 67th Floor's boss raid conference,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.820
Commander Heathcliff.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.080
That was a difficult battle.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.830
We nearly suffered casualties then.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:27.290
Despite being hailed as the top guild, our strength is always barely sufficient.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:33.300
Even so, you're trying to take away one of our precious and vital members.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.510
If she's precious, you should take more care in selecting escorts.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:43.310
I apologize for any trouble that Kuradeel has caused you.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.440
But regardless, we can't just say, "Oh, I understand" after having our vice-commander taken away.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.110
Kirito-kun,

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.400
if you still insist, win her with your sword—your dual wielding.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.280
If you defeat me in a duel, we will relinquish Asuna-kun to you.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.540
But should you lose, you must join the Knights of the Blood.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:09.670
Very well.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.750
If you want to let our swords do the talking, I have no problems with that.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.010
Let's settle this with a duel.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:39.700
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:51.500
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.500 --> 00:23:03.310
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:13.900
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:24.950
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:37.550
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:44.350
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
