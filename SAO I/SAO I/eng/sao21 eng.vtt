WEBVTT

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.380
Yggdrasil...

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.840
There's no mistaking it.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.630
This is Alne,

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.470
the center of Alfheim and the largest city in this world!

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.180
Yeah. We finally made it, huh?

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.310
It's my first time coming to such a massive city.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.980
Me too.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.110
The lights of the mineral towers look like stardust.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:01:00.580
The server will go offline to undergo scheduled
maintenance today, January 22nd, from 4 AM to 3 PM.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.670
Please log out at least ten minutes in advance.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.960
 I repeat, the server will go offline to undergo
scheduled maintenance today, January 22nd...

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.920
I guess that's it for today.
 I repeat, the server will go offline to undergo
scheduled maintenance today, January 22nd...

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.840
Let's head to an inn to log out.
 I repeat, the server will go offline to undergo
scheduled maintenance today, January 22nd...

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.470
Okay.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.760
All right, let's look for one to stay at then.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.640
My wallet's starved now, so
I'd prefer somewhere plain.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.310
That's what you get for trying to impress Sakuya
and the others by donating everything you had.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.900
You should've kept enough for at least
one night of lodging expenses.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.700
Well, you heard your Papa.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.990
Is there an affordable inn nearby?

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.280
Hm...

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.870
Looks like there's a dirt cheap inn down that way.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.750
D-Dirt cheap, huh?

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.420
Come on, let's go.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.710
Hey, wait up, Kirito-kun!

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.890
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.310
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.870
Seeking but a miracle,
kiseki dake wo motome

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.040
I wander in the unrelenting darkness
kienai yami wo samayou

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:42.760
If I remain here, I'll only be trapped in the present.
doko ni ireba nidoto mirai miru koto dekinai

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.390
The moon beckons again tonight,
koyoi mo tsuki ga sasotte

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.100
and while I still can't voice my feelings,
mada kotoba dasenai kedo

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.900
I continue to scream inside my heart.
kokoro no naka sakebitsuzuketa

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.280
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.320
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.910
If only I could have become a little bit stronger,
ato honno sukoshi dake tsuyoku nareta nara

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.170
I would have flown far above these skies
me no mae ni aru kono sora koete yuku kara

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.260
and reached out to the future beyond here.
kono saki ni aru mirai ni te wo nobasu kara

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.780
That's...

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.990
Morning, Sugu.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.700
Good morning, Onii-chan.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.540
You look completely exhausted.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.710
What time did you go to bed last night?

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.750
Um... around four, I guess.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.460
Kids shouldn't be staying up that late.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.670
What kept you up for so long?

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.010
Well... some stuff online.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.600
All things in moderation, okay?

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.810
Not that I'm one to talk, though.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.770
Hey, Sugu, turn around for a second.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.820
Just do it.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.780
Is this good?

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.750
<i>Just how long does this go on for?</i>

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.440
<i>What's this? A guide map?</i>

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.820
<i>Where...</i>

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.320
<i>Where can I find a console to log out at?</i>

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.200
<i>Experiment?</i>

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.170
Onii-chan,

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.470
treat me to green tea shaved ice with red bean and
raspberry cream pie if you want me to forgive you.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.180
I really mean it.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.640
Fine.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.390
Good.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.060
Then how does today sound?

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:36.740
I only have plans for this afternoon, but I'm
thinking of going to the hospital this morning.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.030
Oh, I see.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.280
Say, Onii-chan.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.000
Can I come along with you to the hospital?

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.920
Oh, feel free.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.500
I'm sure Asuna would like that.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.460
Yeah.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.470
All right, let's eat!

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.660
What <i>is</i> this?

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.210
<i>...by stimulating the limbic system of the brain,</i>

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.840
<i>it might be possible to manipulate
thoughts, emotions, and even memories.</i>

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.470
They're suffering!

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.810
All of them are...

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.730
How...

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.230
How terrible!

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.070
He can't get away with this.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.450
No, I'll make sure he doesn't.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.490
Bear with it.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.250
I'll save you soon.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.250
Well then, I wonder how they're doing.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.960
Oh, this guy's dreaming about Spica-chan again.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.470
Fields B13 and 14 are off the charts.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.720
16's getting rather high too.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.390
He's very excited.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.930
Could it just be a coincidence?

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.850
This is only the third time.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.600
No, it's undoubtedly caused by
the emotion-incitement circuits.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.900
For it to be observed at this frequency
 shows it's past the threshold.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.860
Anyway, guess we'll put him down
as a sample for regular monitoring.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.320
Hey, Onii-chan, what are you gonna do about school?

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.830
School?

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.330
You were supposed to start
high school last year, right?

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.080
Well...

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.500
I heard that there's a plan to turn a local high
school that was closed due to reorganization

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:04.840
into a special school for middle and high
school students who were trapped in SAO.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.300
We're now departing.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.310
Supposedly, there's no entrance exam and graduates
will be able to take exams to go to university.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.270
Oh, really?

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.150
Although it sounds like a reasonable idea,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.860
won't the victims feel like they're just being isolated?

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:28.280
Well, we <i>did</i> spend over two years
stuck inside a brutal game of death.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.370
There's no telling how it may
have affected us mentally.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.200
So maybe it's to keep an eye on all of us.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.040
That's just...

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.460
But if I were to try to test into a regular high school,

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.010
I'd have to study an entire
year at a prep school to pass.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.760
Of course, I could always just take the exams cold.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.890
You'd do fine on an entrance exam.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.430
You've always had good grades, after all.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.140
That's a thing of the past.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.350
I haven't studied in the past two years.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.310
Then I'll be your private tutor!

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.240
Then maybe I'll ask for help with
math and information processing.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.460
<i>That's...</i>

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.880
<i>A system console?</i>

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.760
<i>Great, they haven't noticed me yet.</i>

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.520
<i>Please work!</i>

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.490
<i>This is it!</i>

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.750
This hospital is enormous.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.300
The interior is amazing too.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.460
It's like a hotel.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.530
"Yuuki Asuna"-san.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.780
So her character name was her real name, huh?

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.370
There aren't many people who do that.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.540
I didn't expect you to know that.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.080
Asuna's the only person I've
ever known who does that.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.050
I'll introduce you.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.090
This is Asuna.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.380
Vice Commander of the Knights of the Blood.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.340
Asuna the Flash.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.100
She had speed and precision in her
swordsmanship that I was never able to match.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.270
Asuna, this is my sister, Suguha.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.730
N-Nice to meet you, Asuna-san.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.410
Who are you?

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.370
And just what exactly are you doing here?

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.210
Hey, put me down.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.920
I'm a friend of Sugou-san.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.970
He gave me permission to have a look
around and I was on my way out.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.510
Oh? I don't remember hearing about that.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.100
How about you?

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.100
Doesn't ring a bell.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.020
Besides, this isn't exactly the type of
place we'd let people tour around in.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.310
Wait a second.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.690
You're <i>her</i>, aren't you?

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.980
The girl that Sugou-chan keeps
locked up at the top of Yggdrasil.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.190
Oh yeah. Now <i>that</i> I remember.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:58.120
It's not fair that the boss has
such a cute girl all to himself.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.790
There, there, behave yourself.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.620
Stop it!

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.330
Let me go, you monster!

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.500
Jeez, that's a harsh thing to say.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.050
You know, we're in the middle of
a deep-sense mapping experiment.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.670
You're both scientists, right?

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:19.010
Aren't you ashamed to be participating
in this illegal and inhumane research?

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:25.770
I think it's more humane than sticking electrodes into
 the exposed brains of experimental animals though.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.480
They're all just dreaming, after all.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.860
Yes, exactly.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.110
Sometimes, we even show them
delightfully euphoric dreams.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.950
It almost makes me want to take their place.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.370
You're insane.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.370
The boss is on a business trip, right?

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.080
Log out of here and ask him
what we should do with her.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.250
Fine.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.710
Hey, don't mess around on your own while I'm gone.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.050
Yeah, I hear you.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.340
Get going already.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.270
Let go! Let me go so I can leave!

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.520
No can do!

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.480
The boss would murder me for that.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.360
Forget that, how about we have some
fun with electric drugs instead?

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.610
I'm just sick of playing with dolls all the time, you see.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:17.780
S...

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.780
Stop it!

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.490
What are you...

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.500
Stop!

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.170
S-Stop! Ow!

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.170
Okay, I'll stop now!

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.050
I forgot that I disabled the pain absorber.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.270
What are you doing?

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.270
Nothing at all.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.600
Anyway, what did the boss say?

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.400
He went ballistic.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.860
He said to put her back in the birdcage
 above the lab, change the password,

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.240
and keep her under surveillance around the clock.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.950
Darn. And here I thought I could finally have some fun.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.330
Let's at least walk her back instead of teleporting.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.910
I want to enjoy this feeling for a bit longer.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.830
So she's your type too, huh?

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.050
Come on now, just relax.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.510
Keep still.
Let me go already!

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.090
<i>She's beautiful.</i>

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.010
<i>For someone like her to still be asleep...</i>

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.560
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have come, after all.</i>

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.530
<i>I still don't understand my feelings.</i>

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.990
<i>I thought I would if I met Asuna-san.</i>

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:43.370
<i>But...</i>

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.370
<i>do I just want to be a good sister?</i>

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.000
<i>Or do I...</i>

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.270
<i>Onii-chan...</i>

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:19.360
See you.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.400
Let's play again if we get the chance.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.040
<i>I won't lose, Kirito-kun.</i>

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.670
<i>I'll never give up.</i>

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.040
<i>I'll escape this place if it's the last thing I do!</i>

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.980
Leafa?

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.780
What's wrong, Leafa?

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.280
Um...

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.910
The thing is, Kirito-kun...

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.580
I... I...

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.910
I had my heart broken.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.290
I...

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:21.260
I'm sorry for saying stuff like this to
you when we hardly know each other.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:27.390
It's bad etiquette to bring real
world problems here, after all.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.720
Whether it's in the real world or here,
 it's okay to cry when it hurts.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.690
There's no rule that says you
can't express emotion in a game.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.310
Kirito-kun...

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.240
<i>I love my brother.</i>

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.950
<i>But I can't ever let him know that.</i>

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.660
<i>I have to bury these feelings deep inside my heart.</i>

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.290
<i>So I can forget about them someday.</i>

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.430
I'm fine now.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.770
Thanks, Kirito-kun.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.520
You're a nice guy.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.900
There are quite a few people
who'd disagree with you on that.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.230
Want to log off for today?

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.570
I think I can make it on my own from here, anyway.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:27.740
No, I've come this far already.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.240
I'll stick with you until the end.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.290
Come on, let's go.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.800
Yui, you here?

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.430
Good morning, Papa, Leafa-san.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.510
Morning, Yui-chan.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.270
Hey, I was wondering since yesterday...

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.310
Um, do Navi-Pixies sleep at night?

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.100
Of course not.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:07.820
But when Papa's not around, I disable my input
channels and organize accumulated data,

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.200
so, in a sense, it's similar to human sleep.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.870
But you yawned just now.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.870
Humans yawn during their boot-up sequence, right?

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.040
Papa does it for an average of eight seconds.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.330
You don't need to disclose weird facts like that.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.800
Well then, let's head out.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.800
Sure.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.220
It's so lively here.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.930
Just what you'd expect from the center of Alfheim.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:40.520
It looks like players of all races from all
 across the continent are gathered here.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.790
So that's... Yggdrasil.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.550
Yeah.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.590
Seeing it up close like this is breathtaking.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:17.060
Um, there's supposedly a city
at the top of this tree and...

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.850
The Fairy King Oberon and the
fairies of light, the Alf, live there,

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:27.020
and the first race to have an audience with the
king is said to be able to reincarnate into Alfs.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.740
Can you climb up from the outside?

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.870
The area around the trunk is designated
as an off-limit area, so that's not possible.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.830
And even if you tried to fly up, you'd hit the
 flight limit long before you reached the top.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:47.500
I heard that a group of people flew on each
other's shoulders to overcome the limit though.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.760
Oh, that incident.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.720
Apparently, they almost reached the branches.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.470
The GMs must have been in a panic
because it was patched shortly after.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:01.220
Now there's supposedly a
barrier just above the clouds.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.270
I see.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.190
For now, let's head over to the roots.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.730
Yeah, got it.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.050
Once you pass through that gate, you'll be at
the center of the world, Alne's central district.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.350
Hey, Yui. What's wrong?

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.230
Mama...

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.820
Mama's here.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.690
Really?

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.150
There's no mistake.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:55.650
Um...
There's no mistake.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.030
This player ID is Mama's.
Um...

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.740
This player ID is Mama's.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.200
Her coordinates are right above us!

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.420
Kirito-kun—

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.460
Wait!

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.500
Kirito-kun!

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.800
Kirito-kun!

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:22.810
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:32.650
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.500
My endless feelings are lost
tomedonai omoi wa

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.080
in these ordinary days.
nichijou ni nomarete

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:58.260
They waver and change shape yet again.
yurameki nagara mata katachi wo kaeteitta

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.850
I wonder if I'm too late,
imasara mou osoi kana

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.310
but there's no answer in sight.
henji mo nai jimonjitou

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.310
Every decision is up to me,
subete wa sou jibun shidai

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:12.940
whether it's the beginning or the end.
owari mo hajimari mo

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:19.990
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands.
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:27.120
Flying towards the gentle light, I flap my wings.
yasashii hikari wo mezashite habatakuyo

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.210
I embrace the passion
kokoro ni tomoshita

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.420
that flared up in my heart
jounetsu mo daite

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:42.510
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
