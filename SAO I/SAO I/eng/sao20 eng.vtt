WEBVTT

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.110
There's the exit!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.090
That shortened my lifespan!

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.050
But I saved us some time, didn't I?

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.630
Sheesh.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.320
Where are the leaders holding their conference?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.570
Let's see.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.610
Um...

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.200
Beyond that mountain, to the northwest.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.830
And how much time's left?

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.410
Twenty minutes.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.960
Please let us make it.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.840
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.260
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.820
Seeking but a miracle,
kiseki dake wo motome

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.990
I wander in the unrelenting darkness
kienai yami wo samayou

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:51.710
If I remain here, I'll only be trapped in the present.
doko ni ireba nidoto mirai miru koto dekinai

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.340
The moon beckons again tonight,
koyoi mo tsuki ga sasotte

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.050
and while I still can't voice my feelings,
mada kotoba dasenai kedo

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.850
I continue to scream inside my heart.
kokoro no naka sakebitsuzuketa

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.230
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.270
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.860
If only I could have become a little bit stronger,
ato honno sukoshi dake tsuyoku nareta nara

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.120
I would have flown far above these skies
me no mae ni aru kono sora koete yuku kara

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.210
and reached out to the future beyond here.
kono saki ni aru mirai ni te wo nobasu kara

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.270
I don't know if we can get there
before the Salamanders.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.400
Yeah.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.400
And even if we warn them in time, it's likely
that only the leaders would be able to escape.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.110
Or worse, we could all die together.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.030
Players in range!

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.660
A large group of sixty-eight directly ahead.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.580
It's most likely the Salamander assault squad.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.010
There are fourteen other players even further away.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.300
I believe they're the Sylph and
Cait Sith conference attendees.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.680
The two parties will make contact in fifty seconds.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.430
Seems like we didn't make it.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.400
Thanks for your help, Kirito-kun. This is far enough.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.360
You go to Yggdrasil.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.740
I'll save Sakuya alone.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.070
While it didn't last long, I had fun.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.410
I hope we can meet again someday.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.870
I'm not the kind of guy who'd give up here.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.200
Huh?

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.500
Why are the Salamanders...

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.620
Sheathe your weapons, all of you!

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.160
Who's he?

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.120
Sakuya.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.700
Leafa!

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.870
Why are you here?

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.170
It's a bit hard to explain.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.550
But what I <i>can</i> tell you is that our fate lies in his hands.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.510
What in the world...

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.090
I'd like to speak with your commander.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.230
What's a Spriggan like you doing here?

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.360
Regardless of what you say,
I'm still going to kill you all.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.700
But as a reward for your bravery,
 I'll hear what you have to say.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.910
My name is Kirito, and I'm an ambassador
for the Spriggan-Undine alliance.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.700
Since you intend to attack this conference,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.630
can I assume that you're looking to start
a full-fledged war against all four races?

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.590
The Undines allied with the Spriggans, you say?

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.300
And you, who lacks even a proper
escort, are their ambassador?

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.600
Yeah, that's right.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.560
My purpose here is to negotiate trading
between the Sylphs and Cait Siths.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.940
However, if you decide to disrupt this
conference, we'll have to escalate matters.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.690
Our four races would unite against the Salamanders.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.660
I find it hard to believe the words of a
lone man with such humble equipment.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.630
If you can withstand my attacks for thirty
seconds, I'll believe that you're an ambassador.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.340
Why, how generous of you.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.630
This won't end well.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.670
Huh?

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.550
That Salamander's two-handed sword...

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.680
It's the Demon Sword Gram.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.260
Allegedly, you need a two-handed
wielding skill of at least 950 to equip it.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.180
A-At least 950?!

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.140
Yes.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.060
And since he's wielding it, he must
be none other than General Eugene.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.230
Have you heard of him?

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.020
J-Just the name.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.610
He's the younger brother of the
Salamander leader, Mortimer.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.860
This seems to be the case in real life too.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.490
He has brawn to match his brother's brain.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.540
In terms of pure fighting ability, he's said
to be the strongest player in the game.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.750
The strongest player in the game?

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.420
Kirito-kun...

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.900
What was that?!

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.480
The Demon Sword Gram has an
extra effect called "Ethereal Shift",

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.200
which allows it to phase through any
swords or shields you try to block it with.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.950
That's completely overpowered!

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.080
Oh? I'm surprised you're still alive.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.870
What the hell was that last attack?

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.010
This is bad.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.850
Hey, hasn't it been thirty seconds already?

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.430
Sorry, but I've decided to kill you.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.520
Now it's a fight to the death.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.520
You bastard...

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.020
I'll make it your funeral!

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.780
This doesn't look good.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.990
While they appear equally matched, their
weapons are on completely different levels.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.780
Even so...

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.160
Even so, if it's Kirito-kun...

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.860
What's going on?

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.690
I'll be borrowing this for a bit.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.900
K-Kirito-kun?

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.030
Trying to stall for time, are you?!

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.670
He's gone!

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.460
Did he just run away?

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.840
He'd never!

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:08.800
<i>I'll never let anyone in my party
die as long as I'm standing.</i>

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.480
<i>Kirito-kun would never run away.</i>

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.240
Kirito-kun!

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.560
Begone!

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.970
Marvelous! Simply marvelous!

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.060
Awesome! Nice fighting!

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.150
Damn, he's good.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.980
Can't top that.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.770
You have remarkable skills.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.650
You're the strongest player
I've ever seen. Undoubtedly.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.150
Thanks for the compliment.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.780
To think the Spriggans had a fighter of your caliber...

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.030
The world's larger than I thought.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.910
So now do you believe what I said earlier?

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.000
Gene-san, mind if I interrupt?

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.460
Kagemune? What is it?

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.420
He's the guy from...

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.600
<i>I wouldn't want to face you one-on-one either.</i>

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.310
I'm sure you're aware by now that
my party was wiped out yesterday.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.350
Yeah.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.190
The one responsible was none
other than this Spriggan...

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.690
I also recall that there was an Undine with him.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.910
I see.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.620
Let's leave it at that.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:23.580
Certainly, neither our leader nor I wish to antagonize
the Spriggans or Undines at the moment.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.210
We'll take our leave here.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.880
But we shall have another duel in the future.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.590
I'll be looking forward to it.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.850
Looks like there are reasonable people
even amongst the Salamanders.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.100
You're really too much of a daredevil.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.020
I get that a lot.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.530
Sorry to interrupt, but we'd
 like an explanation for all this.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.990
So that's how it is.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:58.450
I <i>did</i> notice that Sigurd has been suppressing
much dissatisfaction as of late.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.240
Dissatisfaction?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.910
With what?

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.710
He... probably couldn't accept it.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.920
The fact that we're playing second fiddle
 to the Salamanders in terms of power.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.130
Sigurd is a man with a thirst for power, after all.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.430
And that's not limited to character stats or abilities.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.640
He earnestly sought after authority as a player as well.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.060
But even so, why would he become
a spy for the Salamanders?

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.440
Have you heard of the upcoming v5.0 update?

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.780
It's rumored to include the
long-absent reincarnation system.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.700
Then...

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.990
Mortimer probably cut him a deal:

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:42.950
If he offered my life to them, he'd be
reincarnated as a Salamander.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.920
So what will you do, Sakuya?

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.210
Lou, you've been leveling up
your dark magic skills, right?

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:54.880
Mhm.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.840
Please link me to Sigurd via Moonlight Mirror.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.190
Sigurd.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.690
S-Sakuya?

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.110
Yes, it's me.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.070
Unfortunately for you, I'm still alive.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:13.730
How—

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.610
I-I mean, h-how was the conference?

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.200
It ended without incident.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.450
We've yet to sign the treaty though.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.910
Oh, right. We had an unexpected guest.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.370
G-Guest?

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.670
General Eugene gives you his regards.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.300
Leafa?

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.800
I see now.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.180
Those incompetent lizards...

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.010
So, what are you going to do, Sakuya?

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.260
Fine me?

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.270
Or drive me out of the government?

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:52.230
But you see, if I, the leader of the army, were to be
dismissed, your political power would suffer too.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.190
No.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:58.070
Since you can't stand to remain as a Sylph,
I've decided to grant your wish.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.570
Wh-What?

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:04.740
You...

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.790
Are you out of your mind?!

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:09.210
You're... You're banishing <i>me</i>?

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.420
That's right.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.340
Wander the Neutral Region as a renegade.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.170
I pray that someday you'll find a new
source of entertainment there.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:19.840
Why you...

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.610
Sakuya?

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.570
You have my thanks, Leafa.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.660
I'm very glad that you came to our rescue.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.070
I didn't do anything though.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.410
If you want to thank someone,
save it for Kirito-kun here.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.290
That's right.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.120
Who <i>are</i> you exactly?

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.080
Say...

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.920
The whole ambassador for the
 Spriggans and Undines bit...

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.960
Was that true?

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.010
Naturally, it was all bull.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.350
A bluff, a lie, a negotiation!

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.810
You're quite the reckless man.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.440
To whip up such a scheme in that situation...

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.980
When I'm dealt a bad hand, I like
to raise the stakes for starters.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.690
For a real fraud, you're pretty strong.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:23.490
Are you the Spriggans' secret weapon... or something?

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.740
'Course not.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.280
I'm just a humble mercenary passing by.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.330
If you're free, why don't you
come work for the Cait Siths?

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.840
We offer three meals, snacks,
and even afternoon naps.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.710
"Kirito-kun," was it?

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.090
Why don't we have a drink in Swilvane,

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.600
both as a token of my appreciation and
an opportunity to become acquainted?

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.350
Hey—

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.730
Oh, that's not fair, Sakuya-chan!

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.690
Using sex appeal is against the rules.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.770
As if you're not doing the same thing!

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.520
You're just <i>all</i> over him.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.990
That's enough!

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.910
Kirito-kun is my—

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.410
My...

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.500
Um... He's my...

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.880
While I do appreciate the offers...

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.640
I'm sorry, I asked her to show me the way to Yggdrasil.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.970
Oh?

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.560
I see. That's a shame.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.100
You're going to Alne, Leafa?

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.690
For sightseeing, maybe?

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.650
Or are you...

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.150
I'm abandoning our territory...

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.860
or at least, that was the plan.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.410
I'll definitely come back to Swilvane,
but I just don't know when.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.410
I see. I'm relieved to hear that.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.330
Be sure to do just that.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.620
And bring him along too.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.250
Stop by at our place on the way back.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.120
We'll give you a big welcome.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:05.170
Thank you so much for today, Leafa, Kirito-kun.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:10.640
If we had been killed, the gap between us and the
Salamanders would likely have become decisive.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.470
I'd like to thank you somehow.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.520
No, it's fine.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.940
Say, Sakuya, Alicia-san, this alliance is
for the sake of clearing Yggdrasil, right?

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.280
Yes, well... That's our ultimate goal.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.070
We'd like to accompany you for that raid.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.410
And as soon as possible.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.120
We don't mind if you do.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.120
In fact, I'd be grateful for that.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.960
But why are you in such a hurry?

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.800
I came to this world in order
to reach the top of Yggdrasil.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.510
So I can meet someone whom I think is there.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.970
Is that someone Fairy King Oberon?

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.640
No, not him...

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.480
I think.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.900
I can't contact that person in the real world.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.190
But I have to meet them, no matter what.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:11.660
Still, preparing the equipment for everyone
in the raid party is going to take some time.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.080
A day or two really wouldn't be enough.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.450
I see.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.870
I guess that's to be expected.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:22.420
Well, for now I'm only planning
to get to the base of the tree,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.090
so I can take it from there somehow.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.920
Oh, that reminds me.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.550
If you don't mind, please top off your funds with this.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.770
S-Sakuya-chan, look!

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.940
This many 100,000 Yrd mithril coins?!

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.070
Are you sure?

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.280
It's enough to build a small castle anywhere you'd like.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.530
I don't mind.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.320
It's of no use to me now.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.870
With this much, we should be pretty
close to the amount we're aiming for!

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.080
We'll arm ourselves as fast as possible.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.410
Once we're ready, we'll be sure to let you know.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.960
I leave it to you.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.300
Thanks! See you later!

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.470
It feels like everything that
just happened was a dream.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.190
Honestly...

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.770
I told you not to cheat, Papa.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.070
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:33.740
When those two were clinging
onto you, your heart was pounding.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.950
W-Well, that's normal for a guy.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.160
Jeez.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.950
H-Hey, Yui-chan.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.210
Am I not a problem?

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.580
It seems like you're fine.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.080
Wh-Why?

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:53.300
You don't really seem like a girl, that's all.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.140
Hey, wha—

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.390
What do you mean by that?!

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.100
W-Well, in other words, you're easy to get along with.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.020
In a good way! Yep.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.770
Now, forget that. Let's hurry over to Alne!

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:06.980
It's getting dark!

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.690
Hey! Wait up!

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:40.890
8, 11, 3, 2, 3, 2, 9.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.650
Kirito-kun, I'll do my best.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:22.850
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:32.690
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.540
My endless feelings are lost

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.130
in these ordinary days.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:58.300
They waver and change shape yet again.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.890
I wonder if I'm too late,

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.350
but there's no answer in sight.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.350
Every decision is up to me,

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.980
whether it's the beginning or the end.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.030
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:27.160
Flying towards the gentle light, I flap my wings.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.250
I embrace the passion

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.460
that flared up in my heart
jounetsu mo daite

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:42.550
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
