WEBVTT

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.440
Yolko-san!

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.210
Asuna, you stay here!

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.250
Hold on!

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.300
Damn!

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.180
<i>Teleportation?</i>

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.560
<i>Where's he planning to go?</i>

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.030
Damn it.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.130
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:20.050
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:28.860
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.150
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.410
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.120
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.250
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.720
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.850
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.520
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.360
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.530
I wanna always be with you.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.530
I'll give you everything I have.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.590
You idiot!

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.960
Don't be so impulsive!

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.090
Well?

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.260
Did you catch him?

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.350
No.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.760
He got away using a teleport crystal.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.770
Inns are designed to protect everyone inside them,
so I assumed we'd be safe from danger here.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.020
Dammit.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.530
That robe was Griselda's...

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.320
That was Griselda's ghost.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.780
She rose from the dead to seek revenge!

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.160
If she's a ghost, PKing in safe areas should be a piece of cake.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.880
That wasn't a ghost.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.050
There has to be a logical explanation behind both safe area murders.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.140
I'm sure of it.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.390
I wonder if the one wearing the black robe really <i>was Griselda-san's ghost.</i>

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.310
After seeing something so unbelievable happen twice...

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.570
I'm starting to think it's not too far-fetched.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.690
No...

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.650
That's definitely impossible.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.620
Besides, if she was a ghost, she wouldn't have used a teleport crystal and—

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.290
Teleport crystal?

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.950
What is it?

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.250
No, it's nothing.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.050
Here.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.050
For me?

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.680
Why else would I be handing it to you?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.480
Do you think I'm trying to mock you?

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.640
I-In that case, thank you.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.690
It'll expire and disappear soon,

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.070
so you should eat it quickly.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.150
O-Oh, okay...

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.410
Delicious.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.500
Where'd you find the time to pack a lunch?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.170
I did say it's about to expire.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.960
I figured we wouldn't have much time to eat,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.670
so I packed it in the morning.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.970
As expected of the Knights of Blood's clearing group representative.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.590
By the way, where'd you buy this?

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.680
I didn't buy it.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.850
It's not from a store.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.230
I <i>can cook, you know.</i>

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.520
U-Uh... How should I say this?

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.570
If you had put this up for auction, you could've made a fortune.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.160
I don't have any more.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.250
What's wrong?

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.340
I see. So <i>that's what it was!</i>

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.180
What is it? What did you realize?

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.510
I...

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.970
We... didn't witness anything.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.810
We thought we did, but we were actually seeing something else.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.600
Safe area murders...

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.860
There weren't any items or methods that would make them possible to begin with.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.240
Griselda...

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.250
All I can do now is beg for your forgiveness.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.710
I'm sorry! I really am!

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.000
Please forgive me, Griselda!

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.040
I...

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.010
I never thought that it'd happen!

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.390
Really?

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.470
Really?

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.200
What did you do?

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.080
What did you do to me, Schmitt?

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.920
I... On the day we decided to auction the ring,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.760
I found a crystal and memo in my belt pouch, with instructions to—

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.640
Whose, Schmitt?

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.850
Whose instructions?

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.690
Grimlock?

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.810
You're dead, too?

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.940
Who was it? Who gave you the memo?

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.950
I-I don't know.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.700
Honest!

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.740
The memo's instructions told me to get access to Griselda's room

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.160
by setting it as the destination of the corridor teleport crystal,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.120
a-and then to put it in the guild bank...

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.120
And?

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.000
That's all I did!

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.630
I never intended to help the murderer.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.510
Believe me! Please!

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.890
We recorded everything, Schmitt.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.780
Th-They're alive?!

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.410
Yeah, they're fine.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.700
Yolko-san and Caynz-shi, too.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.120
B-But...

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.370
In safe areas, a player's HP won't normally drop.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.290
However, objects expire.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.420
Just like the sandwich did.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.380
Back then, Caynz's armor was impaled by the spear.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:27.140
The spear wasn't lowering Caynz's HP, but the armor's durability.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.640
Th-Then what shattered back then was...

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.100
Yeah, it was only his armor.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.650
And at the moment the armor's durability dropped to zero,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.570
Caynz, who was still wearing it...

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.570
used a crystal to teleport away.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.410
The result was an effect that closely mimicked the death effect,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.240
yet was completely different.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.870
So what about Yolko-san?

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.630
She must've talked to us with the dagger stuck in her back the whole time.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.920
The whole time?

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.250
Think back.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.970
Throughout the meeting, she didn't show her back to us even once.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:08.390
As she continued talking to us, she closely monitored the decrease in durability.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:14.730
When it was time, she acted like a dagger was thrown at her from outside.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.610
Which means the man in the black robe was...

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.730
In all likelihood, it wasn't Grimlock.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.570
It was Caynz.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:28.660
Yolko-san and Caynz-shi thought that by using this method, they could fake their deaths.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.580
Moreover, they thought they could spread fear by faking safe area murders.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:38.420
And their goal was to find and expose the culprit of the ring incident.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:43.960
They staged their deaths and created a phantom avenger.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.050
Schmitt was probably under
suspicion from the beginning.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.430
Hey, you still have Yolko on your friend list, right?

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.020
She's at a field on the 19th Floor.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.360
At a small hill a short ways from the town area.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.650
I see.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.110
Anyway, let's leave the rest up to them.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.950
We've done our part in this case already.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.450
Okay.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.000
R-Recorded?

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.260
So that's what it was...

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.260
You two cared for Griselda that much...

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.020
You didn't hate her either, right?

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.560
O-Of course not!

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.560
Believe me.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.690
Well, it's true that because of the rare weapon I had bought with the extra money,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.610
I was able to clear the entrance requirement for the Divine Dragon Alliance...

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.660
<i>Paralysis?</i>

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.920
One down!

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.210
<i>No way. Are these guys...</i>

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.470
This guy really <i>is valuable prey.</i>

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.720
Well, if it isn't a leader of the Divine Dragon Alliance?

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.190
<i>The PK guild, Laughing Coffin!</i>

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.200
Now, how should we play with you guys?

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.620
<i>That! Let's play that, Head!</i>

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.960
The game where we make them fight amongst themselves, sparing the last one standing!

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.000
But we never played it correctly, since you also killed the survivor last time.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.340
If you spoil it like that, it won't be much of a game, Head.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.100
Well then, how about we get started?

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.920
Looks like I'm just in time.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.130
What will you do now?

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.590
Reinforcements will be here soon.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.590
Want to try facing thirty people from the clearing group?

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.610
We're leaving.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.380
It's nice to see you again, Yolko-san.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.590
Once everything was over, I planned to sincerely apologize.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.720
But I doubt you'd believe me, even if I did.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:27.520
I'm thankful you saved us, Kirito, but how did you know?

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.980
That those three would attack us.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.940
I didn't really.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.240
I just concluded that it was a possibility.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:40.870
Hey, Caynz-san, Yolko-san, you two asked Grimlock-san to make those weapons for you, right?

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.420
He was unwilling at first.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.960
He said that he wanted to let Griselda-san rest in peace.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.340
But as we continued to plead, he gave in and made them for us.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.890
Sadly, he wasn't opposing your plan for Griselda-san's sake.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.390
He thought that, if you staged something as outrageous as safe area murders,

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.940
and attracted the attention of many people, someone would eventually figure it out.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.400
I only realized it thirty minutes ago.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.410
I ended up getting toyed with by Yolko-san,

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.280
but it doesn't really bother me.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:22.950
Same here.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.620
Say...

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:32.460
If you were in that situation, what would you have done with the rare drop?

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.800
Well...

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.680
One reason I'm a solo player is because I want to avoid conflicts like that.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.140
In my case, I'd let the person who picked it up keep it.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.680
That's my guild's rule.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.730
In SAO, there's no way to tell who got what unless someone announces their drops.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:54.150
So to avoid any trouble that could arise from that, a rule like ours is ideal.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.570
Also, because of that, in-game marriages actually mean something.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.490
If you get married, your item storage becomes linked to your partner's.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.250
Things that you would have been able to hide before

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.420
come into plain sight with marriage.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.340
Storage sharing is a really pragmatic system,

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.050
but at the same time, I think it's very romantic.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.180
Say...

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.220
What is it?

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.680
Asuna, have you gotten married before?

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.440
No! No! Don't misunderstand!

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.440
I mean, you just said it's romantic and plastic...

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.030
That's not what I said!

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.070
I said it's romantic and <i>pragmatic!</i>

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:45.280
Pragmatic means "practical", just so you know.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.370
Practical? Marriage in SAO?

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.330
Yep. It's really straightforward, after all.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.750
Storage sharing, I mean.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.420
What now?

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.260
Storage... sharing...

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.510
What happens to the items if your spouse dies?

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.470
The item storages are linked.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.430
So what happens to them when one person dies?

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.810
Are you talking about Griselda-san and Grimlock-san?

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.230
Well, if one of them dies...

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.110
Wouldn't the remaining person get all the items then?

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.910
That means the rare ring that was in Griselda-san's storage was...

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:28.580
It should be in Grimlock's storage instead of the murderer's.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.460
So the ring wasn't stolen?

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.960
No, that's not it.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.960
It <i>was</i> stolen.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.340
Grimlock stole the ring that was in the shared storage.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.930
Grimlock...

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:50.140
He was the one who wrote that memo and killed Griselda?

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.140
No, he probably didn't do it in person.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.730
He probably hired a red player to murder her.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.610
Then why...

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:06.240
If he's the culprit, why did he cooperate with our plan?

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.410
You two explained your plan to him, right?

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:16.500
If so, he would be able to use your plan to bury the truth behind the ring incident forever.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.630
Schmitt, Yolko-san, and Caynz-san.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.090
All he needed was for the three of you to gather,

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.380
so he could kill you all in one fell swoop.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.470
I see.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.010
That's...

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.390
That's why the PK guild came here.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:36.190
They've likely been in touch since Griselda-san's murder.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.150
No way...

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.190
I found him.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.490
Let's hear the details from the culprit himself.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.870
Hey, it's been a while, everyone.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.920
Grimlock-san...

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.920
Did you... Did you really...

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.130
Why, Grimlock?!

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.800
Did you really...

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.600
need the money so badly that you were willing to kill Griselda-san, your wife, and steal the ring?!

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.060
Money? Money, you say?

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.190
It wasn't for the money.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.450
I... I had no choice but to kill her.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.990
While she was still my wife...

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.620
We were married in the real world as well.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.880
She was the perfect and ideal wife.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.170
She was cute and loyal.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.260
We hadn't argued even once.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.890
However...

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.430
once we were trapped in this world, she changed.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:19:00.350
I was panicking and cowering in fear at being forced to play this deadly game.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:07.150
Compared to her real-world self, she was more lively and energetic in-game.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.740
I had to accept it.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.660
That my beloved Yuuko had vanished!

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.910
In that case...

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:21.920
In that case, in this world where
 murders go unpunished, I should...

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.500
lock Yuuko away to remain immortal in my memories.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.960
Who would blame me for thinking that?!

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.800
You killed your wife for a reason like that?

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.720
It was more than enough reason to.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.220
You'll understand someday, detective boy.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.230
When you're about to lose love that you just obtained.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.570
No, you're the one who doesn't understand, Grimlock-san.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.780
It wasn't love that you felt for Griselda-san.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.780
You only treasured her as your possession!

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.880
Kirito-san, would you mind leaving him with us?

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.140
All right.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.990
Say...

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.370
Hypothetically speaking, if you got married,

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.660
and discovered a side of your spouse that you never knew existed,

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.120
what would you think?

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.090
I guess I'd consider myself lucky.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.760
I-I mean, marrying someone means,

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.800
you love every side of them that you already know.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.010
So if you discover a new side of theirs and come to love that part of them too,

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.560
won't that mean you'll love them even more?

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.190
Well, I'll leave it at that.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.600
Anyway, I'm hungry.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.360
I missed my chance to eat earlier, too.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.070
Y-You're right...

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.360
We've been away from the front lines for two days.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.650
We'll have to work hard again, starting tomorrow.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:15.610
Yeah.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.330
I want to clear the current floor by the end of the week.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.160
What is it?

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.450
Kirito-kun, let's add each other to our friend lists.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.410
We haven't yet, right?

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.870
It's inconvenient not being able to contact each other since we're both in the clearing group.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.420
But, I'm a solo player, so...

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.000
I never said you had to party with me.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.050
Besides, you need to make more friends.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.880
O-Oh, you think? I don't think it's inconvenient though—

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.970
Think about it over some food.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.680
Let's get back to town now.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.140
R-Right.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:39.700
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:51.500
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.500 --> 00:23:03.310
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:13.900
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:24.950
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:37.550
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:44.350
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
