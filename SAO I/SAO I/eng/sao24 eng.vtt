WEBVTT

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.060
Yui, use this.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.530
Transferring code...

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.190
We'll be teleported.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.150
Papa, your hand!

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.040
Papa.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.040
Papa!

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Yui?

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.920
Where are we?

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.290
I don't know.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.960
There appears to be no map data.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.880
Do you know where we can find Asuna?

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.420
Yes.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.720
We're... We're quite close.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.100
This way!

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.090
This is... the top of Yggdrasil?

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.970
What the hell? So much for the floating city...

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.350
"Grand Quest," my ass.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.310
It was all a sham.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.810
I'll make him pay.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.600
Oh, that's right.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.020
Saving Asuna is top priority right now.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.880
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.310
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.860
Seeking but a miracle,
kiseki dake wo motome

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.030
I wander in the unrelenting darkness
kienai yami wo samayou

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:33.750
If I remain here, I'll only be trapped in the present.
doko ni ireba nidoto mirai miru koto dekinai

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.380
The moon beckons again tonight,
koyoi mo tsuki ga sasotte

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.090
and while I still can't voice my feelings,
mada kotoba dasenai kedo

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.890
I continue to scream inside my heart.
kokoro no naka sakebitsuzuketa

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.270
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.320
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.900
If only I could have become a little bit stronger,
ato honno sukoshi dake tsuyoku nareta nara

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.160
I would have flown far above these skies
me no mae ni aru kono sora koete yuku kara

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.250
and reached out to the future beyond here.
kono saki ni aru mirai ni te wo nobasu kara

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.730
Mama!

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.530
Mama!

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.790
Mama!

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.040
Yui-chan!

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.290
Mama.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.380
Yui-chan.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.550
Mama. Mama!

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.400
Kirito-kun.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.230
Asuna.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.910
Sorry I didn't come sooner.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.040
No, I believed in you.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.290
I knew that you'd definitely come to save me.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.960
Now, let's go back together.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.300
Yeah.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.470
Yui, can you log out Asuna?

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.730
Mama's character data is being
constrained by complicated codes.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.270
We need a system console to free her.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.150
I saw something like that in the la—

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.820
What?

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.580
Yui...

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.700
What's going on?

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.960
Papa! Mama!

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.040
Be careful. Something... bad is coming.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.800
Yui-chan!
Yui!

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.260
Asuna...

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.230
My, what a surprise.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.400
A cockroach managed to find its
way into my songbird's cage.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.610
You're...

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.530
Sugou, aren't you?

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.910
You should refrain from calling me that in this world.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.790
Address me as His Highness, the Fairy King Oberon!

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.000
Kirito-kun!

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.880
Well? Can't lift a finger, right?

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.010
This is gravity magic, which will
be out with the next update, but...

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.430
maybe it's a little overpowered.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.890
Stop it, you coward!

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.390
At any rate, Kirigaya-kun...

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.350
No, maybe it'd be more fitting to call you Kirito-kun.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.440
How did you get all the way up here?

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.480
I saw a strange program running earlier.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.200
I flew up... With these wings...

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.030
Well, no matter.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.120
The truth will reveal itself if
I directly question your mind.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.000
What?

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.250
You aren't thinking that I created
all of this on a whim, are you?

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.630
As many as 300 former SAO players...

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.220
Thanks to their wholehearted cooperation,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:07.730
the fundamental research for the manipulation
of emotion and thought is already 80% complete.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.400
That which has never been achieved by any other,
the direct manipulation of the human soul,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.690
the power of a god!

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.440
Just a bit more and it'll be within my grasp!

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.700
Honestly, <i>thank you</i> virtual reality!

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.530
Sugou!

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.620
You'll never get away with this.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.290
Never!

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.920
Oh? And who exactly is going to stop me?

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.130
I'm sorry to tell you that there's no god in this world.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.000
Except for me, that is!

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.390
Now, before I alter your souls,

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.930
let's have a fun party!

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.320
You bastard, what are you...

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:16.790
There!

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.920
Perfect! I love it!

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.140
NPC women really can't make that face.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.480
What a great fragrance.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:38.190
Reproducing your scent proved
to be quite the challenge.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.400
I hope you appreciate the trouble I went through

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.780
in order to get an analyzer into your hospital room.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.070
Stop it.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.080
Sugou...

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.040
Now, really...

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.540
The audience should just quietly stay put!

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.510
Kirito-kun!

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.470
System command: Pain Absorber...

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.060
Adjusted from Level 10 to Level 8.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.730
Hurts, doesn't it?

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.860
I'll gradually intensify it, so look forward to it.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.700
But keep in mind that once it drops below Level 3,

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.450
it'll apparently affect your real body.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.790
Now, then...

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.500
Stop it, Sugou.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.300
Don't worry, Kirito-kun.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.420
Something like this isn't enough to hurt me.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.180
That's exactly how it should be.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.100
Just how long can you hold onto your pride?

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.890
Thirty minutes? An hour?

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.310
Keep it up for as long as you possibly can!

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.960
Want to know what I'm thinking of doing right now?

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.000
After I satisfy myself here,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.090
I'll go to your hospital room.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.590
Then, while I leave a recording of
this running on a large monitor,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.470
I'll satisfy myself with you there.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.720
With your <i>real</i> body.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.570
S-Sweet.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.120
Sweet!

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.200
Sugou, you bastard!

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.040
You bastard!

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.670
You bastard, I'll kill you!

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.550
Wait until I get my hands on you!

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.520
<i>Is this... my punishment?</i>

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.900
<i>I thought that inside the game world,
I was an invincible hero,</i>

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.950
<i>and even led myself to think
that I could save Asuna alone.</i>

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.450
<i>But in reality...</i>

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.250
<i>I have no power at all.</i>

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.790
<i>So you give up?</i>

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.550
<i>So you give up?</i>

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.970
<i>That's not it.</i>

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.220
<i>I'm just accepting reality.</i>

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.890
<i>So you'll surrender...</i>

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.310
<i>to the power of a system that you once denied.</i>

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.230
<i>What choice do I have?</i>

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.400
<i>I'm just a player, while he's a Game Master.</i>

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.280
<i>Such words disgrace our battle.</i>

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.410
<i>Our battle, in which you proved to me that the
power of human will could overcome my system</i>

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.830
<i>and opened my eyes to the possibilities of the future.</i>

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:18.580
<i>You're...</i>

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.540
<i>Stand, Kirito-kun!</i>

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.810
Compared to your empty attacks,

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:44.270
the blades of <i>that</i> world carried far more weight.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.650
They hurt far more!

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.910
Honestly,

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.870
looks like there are a few strange bugs left.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.210
System login:

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.000
ID Heathcliff.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.290
Wh-What?

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.920
Whose ID is that?!

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.750
System command:

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.840
Change administrator authorities...

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.880
Set ID Oberon to Level 1.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.470
A-An ID that outranks mine?!

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.850
Impossible!

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.680
I am the ruler! The creator!

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.060
King of this world! God!

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.310
Face reality already.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.940
You stole this world.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.820
And its people.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.200
You're a king of thieves that danced
alone upon a plundered throne!

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.660
Y-You brat...

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.580
How dare you...

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.700
To <i>me...</i>

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:48.290
System command: Generate object ID Excaliber!

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.170
Obey me! Piece of junk!

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.210
God's...

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.430
These are God's orders!

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.470
Wait a little longer.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.760
It'll be over soon.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:09.730
System command: Generate object ID Excaliber!

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.280
So a single command can summon
a legendary weapon, huh?

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.290
It's time to settle this.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.170
A battle between a king of thieves

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.880
and a gilded hero!

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.010
System command: Set Pain Absorber to Level 0.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.510
Wh-What?

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.300
Don't run away.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.680
<i>That</i> man didn't, no matter the cost or situation!

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.180
Not Kayaba Akihiko!

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.520
K-Kaya... Kayaba!

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.400
I see.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.360
That ID is...

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.570
Why?

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.900
Why do you get in my way even after you're dead?!

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.700
You've always been that way!

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.820
Always looking down on me like a know-it-all!

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.530
Taking away everything I've ever wanted!

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.580
Sugou,

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.330
I can't deny that I know how you feel.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.500
I, too...

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.040
I, too, lost to that man and
was bent to his will, after all.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.500
But still, not once did I want to be like him.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.920
Unlike you, that is.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.930
You... little brat!

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.730
Damn it!

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.230
It hurts!

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.780
"It hurts"?

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.780
This is nothing compared to the pain
you've inflicted upon Asuna!

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.750
My arm!

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.760
I believed in you.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.220
No, I still do.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.310
I always have and always will.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.980
You're my hero.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.770
And will always come to my rescue.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.730
You're wrong.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.980
I...

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.200
I don't have any power at all.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.990
But I'll do my best to change that.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.500
Yeah.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.210
Now, let's go back.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.170
It's probably already nighttime in the real world.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.050
But I'll be at your hospital room soon.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.970
Okay, I'll be waiting.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.760
I want you to be the first person I see.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.890
It'll finally be over, won't it?

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.810
We can go back, huh?

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.190
Back to the real world.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.360
That's right.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.690
You'll be surprised by how much has changed.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:49.580
Let's go to all sorts of places
and do all sorts of things, okay?

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.740
Yeah, definitely.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.230
Everything's over now, right?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.240
You're there, aren't you, Heathcliff?

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.160
It's been a while, Kirito-kun.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.910
You're alive?

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.330
You could say I am, but you could also say I'm not.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.340
I'm an echo of Kayaba Akihiko's consciousness.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.210
An afterimage.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.920
You never did make things easy to understand.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.180
Well, I guess you have my gratitude.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.050
That's unnecessary.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.560
Why?

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.770
The two of us aren't so well acquainted
that we'd help each other unconditionally.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.940
There is, of course, a price.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.850
Always.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.730
And what would that be?

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.160
What's this?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.370
It's the origin of worlds,

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.620
"The Seed".

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.080
Once it buds, you'll understand its nature.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.460
After that, its fate is in your hands.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.840
You can delete it or even forget about it.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.760
However, if you hold any feelings
other than hatred for <i>that</i> world...

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.970
Well, I'll be on my way, then.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.480
Let's meet again someday, Kirito-kun.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.280
Yui!

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.240
Are you okay, Yui?!

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.950
Papa!

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.490
You're safe!

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.660
Thank goodness.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.700
Yes.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.580
I took refuge inside your NerveGear's local memory.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.540
Where's Mama?

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.710
She went back.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:03.920
To the real world.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.920
Really?

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.170
I'm so relieved!

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.760
I'm so relieved.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.130
That's great.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.010
We'll be back to see you soon.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.970
But I wonder what's going to
happen to this world now.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.140
My core program is stored in your NerveGear.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.520
We'll always be together.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.020
Then I'll be leaving now

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.400
to see Mama.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.360
Okay, Papa!

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.530
I love you!

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.350
S-Sorry.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.770
You were taking a while, so I got worried.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.770
I apologize for taking so long.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.110
Is it over now?

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.730
Yeah, it is.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:10.900
Everything is.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.490
Thank goodness!

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.490
Thank you... Thank you so much, Sugu.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.000
If you hadn't been there, I wouldn't
have been able to do anything.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
No...

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:36.220
I was happy... that I could help you in your world.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.480
You finally brought Asuna-san back, didn't you?

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.110
Yeah, this time for sure.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.030
She's finally back.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.490
Sugu, I...

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.280
Go to her.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.160
I'm sure she's waiting for you.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.460
I-It's freezing.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.420
Oh, it's snowing.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.470
Be careful.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.880
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite
Be careful.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.550
Say hi to Asuna-san for me.
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.510
Yeah, I'll properly introduce you to her next time.
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.720
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:32.570
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.410
My endless feelings are lost

in these ordinary days.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.170
They waver and change shape yet again.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.760
I wonder if I'm too late,

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.220
but there's no answer in sight.

Every decision is up to me,

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.860
whether it's the beginning or the end.

Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:27.040
Flying towards the gentle light, I flap my wings.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.120
I embrace the passion

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.340
that flared up in my heart
jounetsu mo daite

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:42.430
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
