WEBVTT

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.080
<i>Since this game started, almost two years have passed.</i>

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.260
<i>As always, I'm continuing to advance at the front lines.</i>

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.470
<i>I wonder what Kayaba Akihiko is thinking...</i>

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.240
<i>as he watches us from the shadows.</i>

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.500
Guess I'll head back.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.980
October 17th, 2024  74th Floor • Dungeon

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.080
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:57.010
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:05.810
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.110
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.360
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.080
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.210
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.670
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.800
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.470
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.310
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.480
I wanna always be with you.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.490
I'll give you everything I have.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.840
That's...

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.030
Wh-Whoa...

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.200
Isn't this an S-class rare item?!

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.910
I've never even seen this before.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.000
Say, Kirito.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.710
You're not in any need for money, right?

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.880
Trying to sell it...

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.300
Haven't you thought about eating it?

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.720
I have.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.470
It's not something I'm likely
 to find again, after all.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.180
Then why...

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.140
The thing is,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.730
finding someone with a high
enough Cooking level is...

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.640
I guess if we tried to cook it,
it would burn to a crisp...

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.610
Kirito-kun.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.990
Chef captured.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.490
W-What?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.910
Fancy seeing you here, Asuna.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.330
I didn't expect you to come to a dump like this.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.380
It's almost time for the next boss raid, so I came to see if you were still alive.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.220
I'm on your friends list, aren't I?

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.470
Well, now I know for sure.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.350
That aside, what's up?

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.510
You said something about a chef.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.430
Oh, that's right.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.100
Around what level is your Cooking skill right now?

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.400
I maxed it out last week.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.810
What?!

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.440
Impressed?

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.190
In that case, I have a favor to ask you.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.490
Th-This is... a Ragout Rabbit?!

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.040
Here's a proposition.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.580
If you cook this for me, I'll let you have a bite.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.670
I want <i>half.</i>

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.920
Uh, fine...

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.920
All right!

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.260
Sorry.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.350
With that said, it's not up for sale anymore.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.430
We're friends, right?

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.980
Right?

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.060
You could give me a bite too—

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.900
I'll write you an 800-word essay on how good it was.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.860
Y-You've <i>got to be kidding me!</i>

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.280
So, where are we going to cook it?

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.490
Um...

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.830
Your room doesn't even have the proper appliances or utensils, does it?

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.880
Just this once, in respect for the ingredients, I wouldn't mind inviting you to my house.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.210
You're dismissed for today.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.800
Thank you.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.180
Asuna-sama, I don't approve of you inviting such a suspicious man to your house.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.310
His background aside, his skill at least is certain.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.640
He's probably ten levels higher than you, Kuradeel.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.610
I'm inferior to this guy?

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.110
I see! He's the beater...

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.320
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.330
Asuna-sama, guys like him only care about themselves!

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.290
You're just asking for trouble by getting involved with him.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.750
What's going on?

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.080
Isn't she Asuna-sama, "The Flash"?

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.920
Whoa, you're right.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.710
She's cute.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.670
Anyway, you're dismissed for today.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.670
This is an order from your vice-commander.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.470
Hey, wait, is this okay?

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.430
It's fine!

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.940
It's spacious and there isn't a lot of people.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.900
It has a liberating atmosphere.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.410
If you like it, why don't you move here too?

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.870
I have nowhere near enough money to afford it.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:31.000
That aside, was it really okay for you to ditch him?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.300
I said I didn't need an escort, but leaders are apparently required to have one.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.760
In the past, we were just a small guild where the leader personally invited people.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.010
Soon after, we started attracting more people,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.230
and once we came to be known as the strongest guild, everything changed.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.610
Well, it's nothing serious, so no need to worry!

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.450
If we don't hurry, it'll get dark.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.160
R-Right...

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.120
P-Pardon the intrusion...

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.790
Say, how much did this all cost?

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.880
I think the house and the interior cost around four million col total.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.130
I'm going to go change, so have a seat.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.260
O-Okay.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.230
Four million.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.270
Four mega-col, huh?

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.690
I should have earned about that much by now, but...

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.030
How long do you plan to stay dressed like that?

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.160
O-Oh, right.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.670
This is a legendary S-class ingredient, huh?

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.710
So, how do you want me to prepare it?

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.010
I'll leave it up to the Chef.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.180
Let's see...

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.970
Then I'll make it into stew.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.180
Ragoût

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.850
is a stew that's named after the Ragout Rabbit, after all.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.530
Normally, there are a lot more steps to this.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.620
But in SAO, cooking is so
oversimplified that it's boring.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.710
And that's it for the stew.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.880
In the meantime, I'll make some garnish.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.360
An S-class ingredient...

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.870
I've been here for two years now, but this is my first time eating one.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.790
I'm glad I managed to survive this long.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.370
Agreed.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.210
It's strange.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.250
For some reason,

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.550
it feels like I've been living in this world for all my life,

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.880
ever since I was born.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.260
Lately, I've been thinking less and less about the real world.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.220
It's not just me either.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.180
Recently, the number of people trying to clear the game,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.020
fighting ceaselessly for freedom, have dwindled.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.770
Now, all the people fighting on the front lines combined

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.280
don't even add up to 500.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.990
Everyone's become used to it...

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.240
to this world.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.870
Still, I want to go back.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.580
After all, there are plenty of things I've yet to do there.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.250
Yeah.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:07.420
If we give up now, the efforts of the worker-class players who've been constantly supporting us

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.630
will be all for naught.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.760
Stop right there.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.770
What do you mean?

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.730
In the past, that expression had a tendency of preceding a marriage proposal.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.400
Judging from your reaction, you're not close to any other girls, are you?

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.870
That doesn't matter since I'm a solo player.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.750
Kirito-kun, don't you want to join a guild?

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.920
I understand that former beta testers don't get along with groups.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.710
But you know,

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.590
ever since we cleared the 70th Floor,

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.970
I've been getting the feeling that irregularities in monster behavior have increased.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.190
If you play solo, there will be unexpected situations that you can't handle alone.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.070
And you won't always be able to emergency teleport away.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.440
I always keep my health above a certain level.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.740
Besides, when it comes to party members,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.570
they tend to get in my way more often than not.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.330
Is that so?

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.330
Okay, I get it.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.080
You're an exception.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.870
Good.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.750
In that case, party with me, for old times' sake.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.590
This week's lucky color is black, after all.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.010
What're you saying?!

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.220
All reasons aside, Asuna, what about your guild?!

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.680
It's not like we have a leveling quota.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.350
Th-Then what about your escort?

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.220
I'll ditch him.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.830
The front lines are dangerous.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.510
Y-You win.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.230
I guess I should thank you for today.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.480
I enjoyed the meal.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.980
That's my line.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.270
I'll ask you again next time—

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.940
At least, that's what I'd like to do,

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.440
but I doubt I'll find something like that again.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.240
Oh?

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.360
Regular ingredients can taste good too if you prepare them properly.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.750
The world as it is now...

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:50.130
Is it really what Kayaba Akihiko aimed to create?

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.600
She's late.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.190


00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.990
What...

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.700
is this?

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.420
Ouch...

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.970
U-Um... Morning, Asuna.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:51.610
What is it?

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.570
Asuna-sama, please refrain from running off on your own.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.410
Let us return to the guild headquarters.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.700
I refuse!

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.160
Anyway, what were you doing waiting in front of my house so early?

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.420
I predicted this might happen,

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:14.750
so I had taken the responsibility of monitoring you at Selmburg for the past month.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.880
B-But that wasn't part of the commander's orders!

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.180
It is my duty to protect you.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.640
Naturally, that extends to watching over your home.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.890
No, it doesn't, you idiot!

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.850
Please stop being so unreasonable.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.650
Now, let's return to headquarters.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:43.910
Sorry, but your vice-commander will be spending the day with me today.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.120
I'll take responsibility for Asuna's safety.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.120
It's not like we're going to fight a boss.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.170
Go back to your headquarters alone.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.920
Don't be absurd!

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.300
An incompetent player like you couldn't possibly protect her!

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.680
I'm a member of the glorious Knights of the Blood—

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.010
I can do a better job than you can.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.270
Seeing how you're so confident in your abilities,

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.100
you'd be willing to prove them to me, wouldn't you?

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.740
Are you sure?

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.240
Don't worry.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.910
I'll report this to the commander.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.580
Watch closely, Asuna-sama.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.460
I shall now prove that nobody is better suited to protect you than I.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.630
The solo player Kirito and a member of the Knights of the Blood are dueling!

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.840
This'll be quite a show.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.140
P-Preposterous.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.480
Wh-Whoa, he broke his weapon.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.570
Was that his goal?

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.990
You can feel free to try again with a different weapon,

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.370
but don't you think this is enough?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.630
A-Asuna-sama...

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.760
The destruction of my weapon must've been a ruse!

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:13.350
Otherwise, there's no way a dirty beater could have...

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.730
Kuradeel.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.230
I order you as a vice-commander of the Knights of the Blood.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.810
As of today, I relieve you of your escort duties.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.610
Standby at headquarters until you receive further orders.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.110
That is all.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.950
What?

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:27.530
You...

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.840
Teleport to Grandum.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.190
I'm sorry for involving you in this.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.270
No, I'm fine.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.820
But are you okay?

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.530
Yes.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.700
I think the stifling atmosphere of my guild

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.660
is the result of me prioritizing the game's completion,

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.370
which in turn puts so much
 pressure on the other members.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.460
That's...

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.460
I'd say you're doing the right thing...

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:26.340
Besides, if there wasn't somebody like you, the clearing group wouldn't have made it this far.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.300
It's not something a solo player like me should be saying, though.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.220
Anyway, even if you want to take a break by partying with a slacker like me,

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:43.270
I don't think anybody has the right to prevent you from doing so.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.240
Well, I guess I should thank you.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.870
Okay, I'll take you for your
word and take it easy today.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:54.950
Good luck being the forward.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.700
W-Wait a second!

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.830
Shouldn't we take turns being the forward?!

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.120
I'll take care of it tomorrow!

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.500
What?!

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.820
Having a skilled partner makes the fighting a lot easier...

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.320
Kirito-kun, time to switch!

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.700
Y-Yeah, got it!

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.140
Kirito-kun, look.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.100
Isn't this...

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.980
Probably is.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.320
It's the boss room.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.780
What now?

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.910
Should we take a small peek?

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:19.160
Boss monsters never leave the rooms that they're guarding.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.950
Just opening the door is fine.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.870
Y-Yeah.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.920
But just in case, keep a teleport crystal at hand.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.130
Right.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.920
Ready?

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.800
Here we go.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.550
Yeah.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:39.610
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:51.420
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.420 --> 00:23:03.220
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:13.820
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:24.870
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:37.460
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:44.260
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
