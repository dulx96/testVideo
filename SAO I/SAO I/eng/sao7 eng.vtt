WEBVTT

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.360
That should do it.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.780
Thanks, Lis!

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.750
My pleasure.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.250
Aren't you gonna go clearing with your guild today?

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.960
I'm meeting with someone later, so I took the day off.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.290
So <i>that's how it is, eh?</i>

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.000
Wh-What?

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.020
I need to get going!

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.560
You've found something important to you, huh.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.980
Did you say something?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.600
Nope, nothing.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.990
Do your best, okay?

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.160
Jeez, it isn't like that!

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.450
Anyway, see you later.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.000
<i>I wonder if I can find something too.</i>

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.060
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.990
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.790
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.090
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.340
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.060
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.190
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.650
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.780
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.450
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.290
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.460
I wanna always be with you.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.470
I'll give you everything I have.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So-so, I guess.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.390
Serving customers is also part of the job.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.500
All right!

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.380
Welcome to Lisbeth's Smith Shop!

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.340
Well, uh... I'd like to place an order for a custom-made weapon.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.220
<i>I wonder if he can afford it...</i>

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.210
You know, the price for metals has increased recently, so...

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.380
Don't worry about the cost.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.610
I'd just like the best sword you can make.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.600
That's a bit vague...

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.250
I'll need you to tell me what kind of specs you're looking for.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.950
Oh, I see.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.780
Then, how about something that's at least on par with this sword?

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.340
<i>The Elucidator?</i>

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.120
<i>Out of all the swords available from monster drops,</i>

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.760
<i>this one's so good it can be considered a cursed sword.</i>

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.500
Think you can do it?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.750
How about this?

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.020
Amongst all the weapons I've made, it's the cream of the crop.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.830
Feels a bit light.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.190
The metal I used to make it was a speed-type, after all.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.280
Mind if I test it out?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.610
Test it?

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.820
The durability, that is.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.570
Hold it! If you do that, your sword will break!

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.660
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.220
Irreparable...

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.760
What were you thinking?!

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.820
S-Sorry! I didn't imagine that your sword would be the one to break!

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.820
So you're saying that my sword was weaker than you expected?

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.450
Uh... Yeah, pretty much.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.600
For your information, had I the materials,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.220
I'd be able to make countless swords that could snap yours in two, no problem!

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.430
Really, now? I'd love that.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.850
A sword that could snap mine in two.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.770
I-If you're going to say that much, you'll be helping me with everything!

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.510
Everything?

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.610
Yep. Starting from getting the metal.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.450
I can go by myself.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.690
Bringing you along would only slow me down, after all.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.950
Quit belittling me, will you?

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.870
I'm a smith, but I'm also a master mace user.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.020
Really.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.730
So, where's the metal?

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.410
On the 55th Floor, there's a mountain to the west, home to a dragon that lives off crystals.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.540
Rumors have it that it builds up a rare metal inside its body.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.600
The 55th Floor, huh...

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.270
I really sh—

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.850
Apparently, to get the metal, you need a master smith nearby.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.750
Still plan on going alone?

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.930
Just stay behind me where it's safe, okay?

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:23.980
Hey, you...

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.790
My name's Kirito.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.300
Guess we'll be working together until the sword's done.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.860
Sure, Kirito.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.570
Getting informal right off the bat? Not that I mind,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.800
Lisbeth.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.200
It's cold...

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.890
You didn't bring any extra clothes?

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.170
I didn't know the 55th Floor was a frozen wasteland!

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.050
You don't need it?

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.460
I'm a lot more disciplined than you are.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.760
Annoying, every step of the way.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.230
...It's warm.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.860
<i>To think I'm together alone with a guy like him...</i>

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.580
<i>What a strange turn of events.</i>

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.320
What's wrong, Lisbeth?

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.850
Are you already tired out?

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.340
I've got plenty left in me!

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.790
Also, you might as well cut it short and just call me "Lis".

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.920
Okay, whatever, Lis.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.750
Drop the attitude!

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.030
It's beautiful!

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.170
What was that for?

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.100
Get a teleport crystal ready.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.500
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.610
Also, leave this next bit to me.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.450
Once the dragon appears, hide behind some nearby crystals.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.040
Don't come out no matter what.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.150
Why?

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.320
I'm no amateur, so you could use my help.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.200
Stay back!

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.240
All right.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.240
Let's get going then.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.340
Hide over there!

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.600
Got it!

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.110
It's a breath attack! Watch out!

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.500
<i>Amazing...</i>

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.200
<i>With such a small weapon...</i>

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.000
<i>Who exactly are you?</i>

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.050
C'mon, hurry up and end it!

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.220
You idiot! Don't come out yet!

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.640
What? It's almost over, isn't it—

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.860
Lis!

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.410
You're kidding! No!

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.710
Lis, grab on!

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.060
You're alive...

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.460
Yeah, I'm still alive.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.390
Drink this, just in case.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.510
Okay...

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.640
Uh, thanks... for saving me.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.150
It's a bit early to be thanking me.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.880
We still need to get out of here.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.010
Why don't we just teleport?

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.210
Teleport to Lindas!

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.530
No way!

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.470
If crystals don't work here, that means there's another way.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.720
How can you be sure?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.580
This could be a trap designed
to leave players to die!

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.780
Oh, that's true.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.240
You know, you could at least try to cheer me up!

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.850
I've got an idea.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:49.910
Really?

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.560
Yep.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.910
We run up the walls.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.220
Idiot.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.210
Idiot or not, there's only one way to find out.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.170
Whoa.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.190
If I had the space to make a longer approach, I'd have had it.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.000
Don't kid yourself.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.350
This is all so bizarre.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.650
This would never happen in the real world.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:38.410
Staying somewhere I've never been before,
with some stranger, sleeping next to each other...

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.300
And you even tried to run up a wall.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.830
You're a real weirdo.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.750
Sorry if you don't approve.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.230
Hey, Kirito.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.300
Can I ask you something?

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.260
What're you being so polite for?

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.430
Back then, why did you save me?

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:06.520
Rather than leaving someone to die, I'd much rather die together with them.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.750
And if that person is a girl like you, even more so.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.840
You really are stupid.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.030
You're the only one who thinks like that.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.440
Hey,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.500
hold my hand.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.670
Sure.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.480
It's warm.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.750
Both of us are just data in a virtual world, but...

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.740
Lis...

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.080
Huh?

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.220
What's up?

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.350
Here, look.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.020
Is this... what I think it is?

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.860
Yeah, I imagine it's the metal we came looking for.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.030
The dragon eats the crystals, and refines them inside its belly...

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.610
That's why we couldn't find it.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.530
Good find!

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.410
But why was it here of all places?

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.250
This pit isn't a trap. It's the dragon's den.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.250
H-Huh?

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.420
Basically, that ingot is the dragon's excretion.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.210
It's poop.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.930
Well, at any rate, we got what we came for.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:58.680
Now all that's left is...

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.310
Hey, you said that this is the dragon's den, right?

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.020
Yeah.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.270
The dragon's supposed to be nocturnal, so that means that it should...

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.990
It's here!

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.120
H-Hey, wha—

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.920
Lis, hold on tight!

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.600
We're almost out!

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.110
Amazing!

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.540
Kirito!

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.250
You know, I...

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.960
What?

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.970
I love you, Kirito!

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.930
What did you say? I can't hear you!

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.770
It's nothing!

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.820
A one-handed long sword is fine, right?

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.160
Yep. I leave it to you.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.210
<i>The warmth of his hand and my feelings...</i>

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.590
<i>they're both real.</i>

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:05.050
<i>Once I make a satisfactory sword, I'll confess my feelings to him.</i>

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.870
It's called the Dark Repulsor.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.580
Considering it's my first time seeing this,

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.370
I doubt it's listed in the information brokers' directory.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.080
Give it a swing.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.120
Okay.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.510
H-How is it?

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:43.760
It's heavy.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.340
It's a good sword.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:45.840
Great!

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.470
It feels like you put your heart and soul into it.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.900
Well, with this, the job's done.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.480
I'll pay for the sword.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.650
How much?

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.990
Uh, well...

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.410
You don't have to pay.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.080
Instead...

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.540
I want you to make me your exclusive blacksmith.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.250
What do you mean?

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.800
Lis?

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.800
Wh-Whenever you finish hunting in the fields,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.260
come here and let me maintain your equipment.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.510
Every day, from now on.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.020
Lis?

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.770
Kirito, I...

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.150
I'm...

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:41.780
Lis!

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.610
I was worried sick!

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.820
A-Asuna?

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.570
Lis!

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.030
My messages didn't go through, and I couldn't locate you on the map.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.780
Just where were you last night?

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.040
S-Sorry.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.950
I was stuck in a dungeon for a bit.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.500
A dungeon?

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.170
You, by yourself?

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.250
No, I went with him.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.340
Ki-Kirito-kun?!

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.380
W-Well, Asuna...

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.840
Long time no see.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.220
Actually, guess not. Two days no see?

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.890
You surprised me!

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.850
I see. So you already dropped by.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.470
If you had let me know, I would've tagged along.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.560
Do you two know each other?

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.270
Well, we're both part of the clearing group.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.980
He said he wanted a powerful sword,

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.030
so I pointed him to your shop.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.450
Is that so...

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.370
I hope you didn't do anything weird to my friend.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.080
A-As if I would!

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.790
Your stuttering's not helping your case.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.710
We nearly died yesterday, so it wouldn't hurt for you to cut me some slack!

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.840
That's why I kept telling you to not try to handle everything by yourself.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.710
<i>I see.</i>

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.670
<i>So that's how it is.</i>

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.300
This guy didn't say anything rude to you, did he?

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.310
Lis?

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.060
Rude's an understatement!

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.400
He snapped the best sword I had into two pieces!

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.860
S-Sorry...

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.940
It's not something you should be apologizing for, Asuna.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.530
Well, he's weird, but he's not a bad guy.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.620
I'll be rooting for you, so do your best, Asuna!

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.540
I'm telling you, it's not what you think!

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.120
Lis?

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.960
Sorry, I need to stock up on
supplies, so I'll be out for a bit!

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.460
What about the shop?

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.840
I'll count on you two to keep an eye on it!

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.800
What?

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.050
Wait, Lis!

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.820
Lisbeth.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.620
You shouldn't have come so soon.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.210
If you came a bit later...

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.210
I would've been able to go back to being my usual, cheerful self.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.840
Lis...

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.880
How did you find me?

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.850
From there, I scanned the whole town and found you.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.730
Honestly, you come up with the craziest things.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:30.110
Sorry. I'm fine.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.700
I think I just got a bit shaken up with all the sudden adventures.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.320
So...

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.160
Just...

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.460
forget... everything I said.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.130
I want to thank you, Lis.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.800
I've always...

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.630
Always...

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.090
Thought that rather than letting someone die alone, dying together would be better.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.300
I really did.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.760
Kirito...

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:03.980
But, when we fell down that hole together, I was glad that we both made it.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:10.820
It made me realize that I was no exception,
that everyone was living for the sake of living.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.860
So... Thank you, Lis.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.860
Me too...

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.370
You know, I was also constantly searching for it.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.870
Something real in this world.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.710
And for me,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.710
that was the warmth of your hand.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.260
Tell this to Asuna too.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.390
Lis...

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:39.680
I'm fine.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.060
For a little longer, this warmth will remain.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.560
So... please.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.150
Kirito, bring an end to this world.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.570
Until then, I'll keep doing my best.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.780
I promise.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.580
I'll clear this game no matter what.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.080
If your weapons or armor ever need repairs, you know where to go.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.080
Of course.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.840
The Lisbeth Smith Shop awaits your next visit!

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:39.700
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:51.500
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.500 --> 00:23:03.310
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:13.900
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:24.950
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:37.550
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:44.350
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
