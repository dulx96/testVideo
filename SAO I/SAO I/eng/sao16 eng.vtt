WEBVTT

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.620
Oh, you got here quickly.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.000
Looks like business is bad as usual.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790
Shut up.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.710
It's packed in here at night.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.130
So, what should I know about that picture?

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.890
It'll take a while to explain, but first...

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.810
do you know about this?

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.180
A game?

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.020
It's an MMO for the AmuSphere, the successor of the NerveGear.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.320
Then is it a virtual MMO like SAO?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.910
"Alf... heim Online"?

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.950
I heard it's pronounced "Alvhame".

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.160
Supposedly means "Land of Fairies".

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.000
Fairies?

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.840
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.260
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.820
Seeking but a miracle,
kiseki dake wo motome

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.990
I wander in the unrelenting darkness
kienai yami wo samayou

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:51.710
If I remain here, I'll only be trapped in the present.
doko ni ireba nidoto mirai miru koto dekinai

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.340
The moon beckons again tonight,
koyoi mo tsuki ga sasotte

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.050
and while I still can't voice my feelings,
mada kotoba dasenai kedo

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.850
I continue to scream inside my heart.
kokoro no naka sakebitsuzuketa

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.230
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.270
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.860
If only I could have become a little bit stronger,
ato honno sukoshi dake tsuyoku nareta nara

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.120
I would have flown far above these skies
me no mae ni aru kono sora koete yuku kara

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.210
and reached out to the future beyond here.
kono saki ni aru mirai ni te wo nobasu kara

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.760
"Land of Fairies," huh?

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.600
Is it a casual game?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.520
No, apparently not.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.150
It features an extreme-skill system, which emphasizes a player's skill and encourages PKing.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.110
Extreme-skill system?

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.030
It means that players don't have levels.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.410
Each skill is improved through grinding

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.660
and combat depends on a
player's physical capabilities.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.410
Sounds tough.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.630
It's like SAO, but with magic instead of sword skills.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.340
I hear that it's all the rage lately.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.090
The reason being that you can fly in it.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.550
Fly?

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.550
Since the players are fairies, they have wings.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.050
The game has a built-in flight engine,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.510
which allows for free-roaming flight once a person becomes accustomed to it.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.310
How do the controls for it work?

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.730
No clue.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.350
But I hear it's pretty hard to master.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.900
Well, that's a given.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.230
You'd be manipulating wings that humans don't have.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.610
Maybe it's controlled with back muscles.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.790
So, how's a popular game like this related to Asuna?

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.250
What do you think?

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.540
It looks like Asuna.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.250
I thought you'd agree.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.470
Hurry up and tell me. Where was this taken?

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.300
Inside the game—

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.140
in Alfheim Online—

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.970
at what's called Yggdrasil, or the World Tree.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.690
There's a legendary castle atop this tree.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.650
Players are divided into nine races

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.110
and they compete to see who can reach the castle first.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.320
Can't they just fly there?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.950
There's supposedly a flight duration limit, so it's not possible to fly endlessly.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.960
And so, five players piggybacked on each other in order of size and used each other like rocket boosters.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.960
I see.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.880
It's a ridiculous idea, but ingenious at the same time.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.260
Even so, they couldn't even reach the tree's lowest branch, but...

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.430
they did take a few pictures.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.760
One of those pictures showed something strange.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.390
A birdcage?

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.230
And when you zoom in as close as possible what you get is...

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.730
this.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.900
But, why is Asuna in a place like this?

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.490
"RCT Progress"?

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.490
<i>In other words, it wouldn't be wrong to say Asuna's life is being sustained by me.</i>

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.920
Agil, mind giving this to me?

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.710
Not at all, but are you planning to go there?

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.670
I want to see it for myself.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.680
A game where your life isn't on the line is a piece of cake.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.060
I'll need to buy the hardware too.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.060
It's compatible with the NerveGear.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.520
The AmuSphere is just a safer NerveGear, after all.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.360
Good to know.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.610
Bring Asuna back to the real world.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.410
Until then, our fight isn't over.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.870
Yeah.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.370
Let's all meet up here someday.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.380
I'm being so stupid!

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.720
I'm back.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.510
Onii-chan!

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.490
Here.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.080
I-I thought I was a goner.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.240
That was careless of you.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.790
You shouldn't eat too quickly.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.750
Sugu, about last night...

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.710
Y-Yeah?

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.010
Well, how should I say it...

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.970
Thank you.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.640
Because of you, I finally snapped out of it.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.970
I'm not going to give up.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.430
I'm going to bring Asuna back no matter what.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.190
Sure.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.190
Give it your best.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.730
I'd like to meet Asuna-san too.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.070
I'm sure you'd get along with her.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.450
Well then, see you later.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.880
<i>The ceremony will be held in a week, on January 26th, in this hospital room.</i>

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.390
<i>...you're invited.</i>

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.220
Lend me your strength once more.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.860
Link Start!

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.250
Welcome to Alfheim Online.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.170
To begin, please enter your
character's gender and name.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.760
<i>Really? So </i>you're <i>that hero, Kirito-kun!</i>

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.900
The next step is race selection.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.070
Please choose one of the nine races.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.910
Guess I'll go with this one.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.410
Spriggan, correct?

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.540
Your character's appearance will be randomly generated.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.250
Is that all right?

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.590
You will now be transferred to the Spriggans' hometown.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.510
We wish you the best of luck.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.210
What's happening?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.490
And here I go again.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.210
Even after having gone through all that.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.170
Anyway, where am I?

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.470
It's here!

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.480
So what about my stats...

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.320
What in the...

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.280
Is this a bug?

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.410
They're the same as my skill levels in SAO.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.120
What's going on?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.750
Is this SAO?

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.260
Wait.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.760
Please... be here.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.810
It's me, Yui.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.100
Remember?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.940
We meet again, Papa.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.490
Yui!

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.700
<i>Mama!</i>

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.530
<i>You're hungry, aren't you?</i>

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.660
<i>Let's have breakfast.</i>

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.250
<i>Okay!</i>

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.380
<i>Yummy...</i>

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.010
<i>Mama...</i>

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.380
<i>Papa...</i>

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.850
Papa!

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.470
Papa...

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.270
Miracles really <i>do exist.</i>

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.410
So, what exactly is going on here?

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.210
Well, this world isn't SAO.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.340
It's a different one from a game called Alfheim Online.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.260
Please hold on for a moment.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:18.470
I believe this world is a copy of Sword Art Online.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.890
A copy?

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:20.680
Yes.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.690
The main programs and graphics format are completely identical.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:30.610
However, they seem to be using an older version of the Cardinal system.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:37.450
After Argus went under, a company called RCT was entrusted with the post-management of SAO.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:43.120
In other words, RCT is taking advantage of the Argus technology that they inherited.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.080
But why did my character data remain?

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.920
Please let me take a quick look at your data.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.010
There's no doubt about it.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:59.680
This is the character data of your SAO avatar.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.350
The save data format was practically unchanged,

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.940
so the skill levels that were carried over from SAO must have overwritten your base stats.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.400
That's right, my Dual-Wielding skill is gone.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.820
Your items... seem to be missing as well.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.320
It'd be best to get rid of them before an error inspection program notices.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.740
I see.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.800
Okay, what should I do about my skills?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:48.100
You shouldn't need to worry about that as long as a human Game Master doesn't check them personally.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.150
I-I see.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:55.190
Forget being a beater, I'm just a cheater now.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.780
What does the system categorize you as?

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.450
Um...

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:06.790
I'm seen as an artificial personality program for player support—a navigation pixie.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.290
Hey!

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.090
This is how I look as a pixie.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.220
That tickles!

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.520
So, do you have admin authority like before?

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.900
No, I'm only capable of referencing and accessing wide-area map data.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.820
I see.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:43.160
The truth is, we might find Asuna—Mama—here.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.080
Huh? Mama?

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.790
What do you mean?

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:52.540
Even after we cleared SAO, Asuna didn't wake up in the real world.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.800
I was informed that there's someone who looks like Asuna in Alfheim.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.720
I see...

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.010
I have a general idea of where we can find her.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.850
Someplace called Yggdrasil.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.890
That's probably it..

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.430
Mama's over there?

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.570
That reminds me.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.490
Why did I end up in this deserted forest when I logged in?

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.610
I was supposed to have been sent to my hometown.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.450
I wonder.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:30.000
Maybe your location data was corrupted or maybe there was some sort of interference.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.710
Either way, it'd have been nice if I ended up closer to Yggdrasil.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.300
Oh, so these are my wings?

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.010
How do I use them?

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.430
There should be a support controller.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.560
Raise your left hand and close it as if you were grasping something.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.190
Um, pull it towards yourself to ascend,

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.730
push it outwards to descend,

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.690
and move it left or right to turn.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.030
Push down on the button to accelerate,

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.290
and release it to decelerate.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.500
You can fly as long as your wings are glittering.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.420
After a certain amount of time, you need to let your wings rest.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.310
All right, I think I got the hang of this.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.650
For starters, can you tell me where the closest town is?

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:41.360
There's a Sylph town called Swilvane to the west.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.900
That's the closest—

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.820
What's wrong?

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.780
There are other players close by.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.630
Lea... Leafa-chan!

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:08.760
Wait!

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.010
Hurry up, Recon.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.470
If we can manage to reach Sylph territory—

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.560
Recon, dodge to the side!

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.770
Jeez, they're persistent!

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.190
Fine then.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.070
Prepare for battle!

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.410
What?! We can't!

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.910
I'm sure Sigurd and the rest were...

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.330
I'll draw their attention for as long as I can,

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.200
so take one of them down in the meantime.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.460
I'll do my best.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.580
Show me your capable side for once.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.520
Damn it!

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.830
We'll win at this rate.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:18.540
You idiot! Keep moving!

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.500
Sorry!

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.550
Recon!

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.830
My apologies, but orders are orders.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.460
If you forfeit your money and items, we'll let you go.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.920
What are you being so polite for, Kagemune?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.550
It's been ages since we last fought a girl.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.920
Let's slaughter her.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.640
I'll make sure to take at least one of you down with me.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.850
Come at me if you're prepared to die!

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.810
You're a strong-willed girl.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.810
It seems I have no choice.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.760
Landings are going to be the end of me...

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.310
What are you doing?! Get out of here!

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.890
Three tanks ganging up on one girl?

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.060
Now isn't that embarrassing?

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.650
What did you say?!

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.190
You're out of your league, newbie!

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.530
We'll take you out first then!

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.220
So...

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.600
Is it okay for me to kill these guys?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.390
S-Sure, why not?

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.520
It's probably what they were
intending to do to us anyway.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.060
Well then, don't mind if I do.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.780
He disappeared!

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.010
Who's next?

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:22.850
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:32.690
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.540
My endless feelings are lost
tomedonai omoi wa

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.130
in these ordinary days.
nichijou ni nomarete

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:58.300
They waver and change shape yet again.
yurameki nagara mata katachi wo kaeteitta

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.890
I wonder if I'm too late,
imasara mou osoi kana

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.350
but there's no answer in sight.
henji mo nai jimonjitou

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.350
Every decision is up to me,
subete wa sou jibun shidai

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.980
whether it's the beginning or the end.
owari mo hajimari mo

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.030
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands.
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:27.160
Flying towards the gentle light, I flap my wings.
yasashii hikari wo mezashite habatakuyo

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.250
I embrace the passion
kokoro ni tomoshita

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.460
that flared up in my heart
jounetsu mo daite

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:42.550
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
