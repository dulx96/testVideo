WEBVTT

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.200
This is...

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.490
amazing...

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.870
Yeah...

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.580
It's like this every day.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.040
Is Yui-chan okay?

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.540
We made sure she got a good night's sleep,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.340
so she's recovered.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.550
Has this ever happened before?

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.380
We don't know.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.930
She was wandering around in a forest on the 22nd Floor.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.850
It seems... she's lost her memories.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.930
My...

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.100
That's why we came here—

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.190
We figured there might be
someone here that knows her.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.740
Anybody in particular come to mind?

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.280
Sadly, I don't think she ever lived in the Starting Town.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.160
When the game began, most of the children were traumatized.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.170
I couldn't leave them to fend for themselves, so I brought them to this church.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.970
I walk around town every day looking for children in need,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.470
but I've never seen anybody who looks like Yui-chan.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.100
I see.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.060
Pleased to meet you.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.020
I'm Yuriel.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.440
You're from the Army, right?

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.730
Have you come to rebuke us for our actions yesterday?

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.190
Not at all. Far from it.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.740
In fact, it's the opposite.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.570
I actually wish to thank you for a job well done.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.490
I've come today to ask for your assistance.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.000
Assistance?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.090
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.020
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.820
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.120
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.370
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.090
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.220
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.680
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.810
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.480
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.320
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.490
I wanna always be with you.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.500
I'll give you everything I have.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.430
Originally, we—

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:39.390
No, our guild leader, Thinker, never intended to create the oppressive organization that we are today.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.310
He only wanted to provide information and food to all those who needed it.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.530
But then, the Army grew too large.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.820
Yes.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.490
In the midst of internal struggles,
a man called Kibaou rose to power.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.040
Kibaou's faction grew in power,
monopolized efficient hunting grounds,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.790
and even went as far as to extort people under the pretense of tax collection.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.920
However, an increasing number of people disapproved of Kibaou's neglect toward clearing the game,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.050
leading him to dispatch his highest-leveled players to the front lines.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.560
Kovats-san...

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.100
The terrible outcome caused Kibaou to be heavily reprimanded.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.860
It even reached the point where we'd have
been able to exile him from the guild, but...

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.820
in an act of desperation, Kibaou lured Thinker into a trap.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.410
Thinker was deserted, deep inside a dungeon.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.580
What about teleport crystals?!

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.500
Did he go empty-handed?!

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.170
He was too trusting.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.920
He agreed to Kibaou's request to converse unarmed...

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.340
It happened three days ago.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.510
Three days ago?

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.800
So where's Thinker-san now?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.140
He's deep inside a rather high-level dungeon,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.600
and it seems he's unable to escape...

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.440
As his aide, I'm to blame for everything that's happened.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.530
However, it's impossible for me to save him at my level,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.320
and due to Kibaou's influence, I can't count on the Army either.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.790
That's why, when I heard that two players of untold power appeared in town,

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.830
I immediately went to seek their assistance.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.580
Kirito-san, Asuna-san,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.670
will you please accompany me to rescue Thinker?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.090
If it's something we're capable of, we'd like to help you.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.600
Still, we need to confirm your story first.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.770
I'm aware that I'm being unreasonable.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.770
But when I wonder how he's doing,

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.060
I... feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.530
It's okay, Mama.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.820
She's not lying.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.080
Y-Yui-chan, you can tell?

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.330
Yeah.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.870
I dunno how to explain it... but I can.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.260
I'd rather regret trusting her than regret doubting her.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.970
Let's go.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.970
It'll work out somehow,

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.720
right?

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.430
You're as optimistic as ever.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.230
We'll do what we can to help you.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.030
I cannot thank you enough.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.860
I can sympathize with your feeling of
wanting to save someone dear to you.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.990
Wait here until we're back, okay?

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.370
No, I'm going too!

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.870
Yui-chan, let's wait for them here together.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.250
No!

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.750
Wow, so this is the so-called "rebellious phase", huh?

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.590
Don't be silly!

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.880
Yui-chan, the place we're headed to is dangerous.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.550
I'm going too!

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.060
I never imagined a dungeon like this
would be beneath the Starting Town...

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.980
This wasn't around during the beta test.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.100
How careless.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.400
It's probably an area that wasn't accessible until certain floors higher up were cleared.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.070
Kibaou was planning to monopolize this dungeon.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.910
There <i>is a lot to be gained with a personal hunting ground.</i>

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.080
Nevertheless, strong monsters from the 60th Floor spawn here,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.240
so it seems he wasn't able to hunt much.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.210
This is the entrance.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.170
I'm not scared.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.420
It's fine.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.010
She's much stronger than she looks.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.720
I'm sure she'll grow up to be a fine swordswoman.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.890
Then let's continue.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.250
I-I apologize for not being of any help.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.750
It's fine. He's more than willing to do all the fighting.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.040
You should just leave it to him.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.840
We've come pretty far. Are we close?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.720
Thinker has not moved from this position.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.930
I have reason to believe that he's in a safe area.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.560
If we get there, we can use our teleport crystals.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.150
Man, that was a nice mob!

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.110
Sorry about that.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.940
Well,

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.030
I do it because I want to and I get drops too.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.490
Oh, did something good drop?

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.110
Yep!

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.700
Wh-What <i>is that?</i>

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.240
Scavenge Toad Meat.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.620
What, from the frogs earlier?!

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.870
They <i>do say the stranger it is, the better it tastes.</i>

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.830
Cook it for me later!

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.210
Not in a million years!

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.880
Wh-What are you doing?!

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.800
Dammit!

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.300
If that's how you wanna play...

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.800
How's this?!

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.970
No!

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:08.600
No! No! No! No!

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.140
A-Asuna!
No! No! No! No!

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.350
M-My precious meat!

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.930
Toss it already!

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.890
I'm telling you, they're delicious!

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.190
You laughed!

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.230
That's the first time I've seen you laugh!

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.330
Come on, let's go.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.800
It's a safe area.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.510
There's a player inside it.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.020
Thinker!

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.350
Hey, wait!

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.230
Yuriel!

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.860
Thinker!

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.400
Don't come this way!

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.160
That passage is—

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.540
Stop!

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.580
Yuriel-san, come back!

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.390
Yuriel-san.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.600
Please take refuge in the safe area with Yui.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.810
O-Okay!

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.390
Mama...

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.270
Come.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.540
Asuna.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.460
Take Yui and the others and escape using the teleport crystals.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.210
Even with my Identification Skill, I can't read its data.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.130
It seems like a monster that belongs on the 90th Floor.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.890
I'll buy you guys time, so hurry!

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.260
Ki-Kirito-kun, not without y—

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.600
I'll catch up!

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.220
Hurry!

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:17.850
Mama...

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.350
Take care of Yui!

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.440
Please escape with her!

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:23.980
Asuna!

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.610
We couldn't—

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:26.940
Hurry!

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.810
Kirito-kun!

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:03.770
Yui-chan, stop!

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:04.480
It's dangerous!

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.860
Come ba—

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.160
You idiot! Get out of here already!

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.870
Yui-chan!

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.790
It's okay, Papa, Mama.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.170
Yui-chan!

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.890
An immortal object?!

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.870
Yui-chan...

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:46.670
Yui...

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.670
Papa, Mama.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.210
My memories are back.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.140
Yui-chan, do you remember everything from before?

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.180
Yes.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.850
Kirito-san, Asuna-san,

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:16.200
the world called Sword Art Online is controlled by one massive system.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.620
Its name is Cardinal.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.830
This system, which was designed to
function without human maintenance,

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:30.500
controls the balance of SAO under its own judgement.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.130
Everything from the AIs of monsters and NPCs

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.710
to the drop rates of items and currency

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:41.220
is controlled by programs managed by Cardinal.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.180
Even the mental health care of players.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:51.810
Mental Health Counseling Program - Prototype #1. Code Name: Yui.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.150
That's what I am.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.570
A program?

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.150
So you're an AI?

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:05.080
In order for me to effectively interact with players, I was given the ability to emulate emotions.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.120
Nothing about me is genuine.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.670
Even these tears.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.540
I'm sorry, Asuna-san.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.920
Yui-chan...

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.970
But you lost your memories...

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.220
Can that happen to an AI?

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.520
Two years ago,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.350
on the day of the game's official launch,

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:37.320
for some reason, Cardinal ordered me to not interact with the players in any way.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.990
Unable to do anything else, I only continued monitoring the mental health of players.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.950
The situation was simply terrible.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.210
No!

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.930
The players were overwhelmed by negative emotions like fear, despair, and rage.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.930
Some were even driven to insanity.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:14.400
Normally, I would've gone to help those players immediately.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.980
But I was forbidden from interacting with them.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:24.910
I steadily accumulated errors until I broke down.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:37.540
Then one day, I noticed two players with mental parameters that greatly differed from the others.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.880
Joy...

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.010
Tranquility...

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.180
But that wasn't all.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:55.350
I wanted to get a little closer to you two, so I wandered in the fields.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.860
So that's why you were in the woods on the 22nd Floor?

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.820
Yes.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.780
Kirito-san, Asuna-san,

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.110
I always wanted to meet the two of you.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:06.910
It's strange, isn't it?

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.450
I shouldn't even be able to think that.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.210
I'm nothing more than a program.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.080
Yui-chan...

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.630
You're just like a human, aren't you?

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.550
I don't know.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.090
I'm not sure what happened to me.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.520
Yui, you're no longer a program under the control of the system.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.110
So you should be able to tell us what you want.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.690
What do you wish for?

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.200
I...

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.450
I...

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.080
I want to always be with you.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.880
Papa, Mama!

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.180
Always...

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.510
We'll always be together, Yui-chan!

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.140
Yeah, you're our child.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.400
It's... too late.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.400
Too late?

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:31.910
This is a console that allows GMs emergency access to the system.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.410
I used this to eliminate that monster.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.790
But as a result, it started running a check on my program.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:48.550
And since I disobeyed an order from Cardinal, I'm now considered a foreign object.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.970
I'll soon be deleted by it.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.850
No way...

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.140
Can't anything be done?

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.940
Papa, Mama, thank you.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.100
This is goodbye.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.440
No!

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.280
I can't accept that!

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.150
This is only the beginning!

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:13.450
We can live happily, enjoying our days together!

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.410
Yui, don't go!

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:22.000
When they're together with you, everyone can smile.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.590
Please...

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:29.420
Continue to save everyone in my stead...

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.050
and share your happiness with them.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.470
No! No!

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.720
If you're not with me, I won't be able to smile again!

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.440
Mama, smile.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.340
Cardinal—

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.050
No, Kayaba!

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.730
Don't think things will always go your way!

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.810
Kirito-kun, what are you...

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:29.190
Right now, I might be able to use this GM account to bypass the system!

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.580
Kirito-kun!

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.910
Are you okay?

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:49.960
What's this?

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:59.100
Before Yui's admin authority was disabled, I freed her main program and converted it into an object.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.930
Then this is...

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.890
It's Yui's heart.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.280
<i>Hey, Kirito-kun.</i>

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.080
<i>Hm?</i>

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.670
<i>If the game gets cleared and this world
disappears, what would happen to Yui-chan?</i>

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:32.670
<i>Yui's data is set to store itself in my NerveGear's local memory.</i>

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:37.930
<i>It'll probably be tough getting it to
render properly outside of this world,</i>

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.930
<i>but I'm sure it'll work out.</i>

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.150
<i>I see.</i>

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.610
<i>So we'll be able to see Yui again someday.</i>

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.150
<i>Our... first child.</i>

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.410
<i>Yeah, definitely.</i>

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.120
Hey, Asuna?

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.920
<i>Mama, do your best.</i>

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:39.660
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:51.460
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.460 --> 00:23:03.260
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:13.860
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:24.910
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:37.510
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:44.300
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
