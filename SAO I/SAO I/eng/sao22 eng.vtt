WEBVTT

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.520
Mama...

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.150
Mama's here.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.110
Really?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.650
There's no mistake.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.990
Um...
There's no mistake.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.570
This player ID is Mama's.
Um...

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.110
This player ID is Mama's.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.540
Her coordinates are right above us!

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.750
Kirito-kun—

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.330
Wait!

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.290
Kirito-kun!

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.470
<i>Kirito-kun, why are you so desperate?</i>

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
<i>Is the person at the top of
Yggdrasil that important to you?</i>

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.520
Watch out, Kirito-kun!

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.310
The barrier's right above you!

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.110
Kirito-kun!

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.860
Stop!

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.080
Quit it, Kirito-kun!

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.830
It's impossible!

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.040
This is as high as you can go!

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.080
I have to continue.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.090
I have to get up there.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.840
Mama, it's me.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.300
Mama!

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.850
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.280
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.830
Seeking but a miracle,
kiseki dake wo motome

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.000
I wander in the unrelenting darkness
kienai yami wo samayou

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.720
If I remain here, I'll only be trapped in the present.
doko ni ireba nidoto mirai miru koto dekinai

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.350
The moon beckons again tonight,
koyoi mo tsuki ga sasotte

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.060
and while I still can't voice my feelings,
mada kotoba dasenai kedo

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.860
I continue to scream inside my heart.
kokoro no naka sakebitsuzuketa

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.240
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.290
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.870
If only I could have become a little bit stronger,
ato honno sukoshi dake tsuyoku nareta nara

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.130
I would have flown far above these skies
me no mae ni aru kono sora koete yuku kara

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.220
and reached out to the future beyond here.
kono saki ni aru mirai ni te wo nobasu kara

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.300
Mama...

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.930
Mama.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.100
Y-Yui-chan,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.900
is that you?

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.110
Mama! Mama!

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.860
I'm right here.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.660
I'm up here.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.120
I'm up here, Yui-chan!

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.370
Kirito-kun!

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.920
<i>Something...</i>

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.630
<i>Something that I can drop from here...</i>

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.930
What the heck is this?!

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.230
I tried to call her using Warning Mode, but...

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.650
What's that?

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.660
A card?

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.790
Leafa, do you know what this is?

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.630
No, I've never seen an item like that before.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.130
There's no item window for it.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.090
This...

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.050
This contains an access code
 for System Administrators.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.480
Then can we use this to exercise GM authority?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.390
No.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.570
To do that from inside the game would
require a corresponding console.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.320
Even I can't bring up the system menu.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.900
I see.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.410
But... there has to be a reason why this fell down.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.910
This is probably...

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:23.580
Yes!

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.380
I think Mama heard me and dropped it.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.390
<i>Asuna...</i>

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.690
Leafa, I have a question.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.270
Where's the gate that leads into Yggdrasil?

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.240
Um, it's inside the dome at the tree's base.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.900
B-But you won't be able to get in!

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.780
It's protected by guardians which even
 the largest raid parties couldn't get past!

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.870
Even so, I have to go.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.420
Thank you for everything up until now.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.880
From here on out, I'll continue alone.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.490
Kirito-kun...

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.620
Let's get going then.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.630
Sounds good.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.090
Wh-What the...?

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.050
Some sort of event?

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.510
Yui, do you know the way to the dome?

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.260
Yes, if you go up the stairs ahead of us, it'll be—

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.390
B-But are you sure about this, Papa?

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.860
Judging by what we've learned so far, breaking
through the gate will be quite a difficult feat.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.110
We'll have to see that for ourselves.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.570
Even if we fail, there's no death penalty here.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.860
That's true, but...

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.330
And besides, if I were to waste another
second doing nothing, I'd lose my mind.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.380
You want to see Mama soon too, right?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.130
Yes.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.620
You who has yet to experience the heights of the sky...

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.380
Do you seek passage to the king's castle?

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.920
<i>Wait for me, Asuna.</i>

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.390
<i>I'll be there soon.</i>

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:31.180
Then prove you are worthy of soaring
the skies with those wings you bear.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.400
Here we go, Yui.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.570
Make sure to keep your head down.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.660
Papa, good luck.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.460
Here I go!

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.350
Out of my way!

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.190
<i>I can do this!</i>

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.890
<i>Die.</i>

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.940
Die!

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.370
<i>Asuna...</i>

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:39.580
<i>Asuna...</i>

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:46.000
<i>Asuna...</i>

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.880
<i>Asu—</i>

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.280
<i>Just...</i>

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.110
<i>Just a bit further... </i>

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.680
<i>Just a bit further...</i>

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.650
<i>I'm...</i>

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.700
<i>I'm...</i>

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.410
<i>dead, huh?</i>

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.380
<i>This world...</i>

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.420
<i>A part of me believed it was just a game.</i>

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.680
<i>Is this my punishment for that?</i>

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.680
<i>After all, my strength...</i>

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.350
<i>only amounts to skills and stat points.</i>

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.400
<i>I thought I could overcome this game's boundaries...</i>

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.240
<i>and my limits, so I could do anything.</i>

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.660
<i>A game where your life isn't on the line is a piece of cake.</i>

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.380
<i>Asuna...</i>

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.520
<i>No...</i>

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.230
<i>Stay away!</i>

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.950
Kirito-kun!

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.140
Kirito-kun...

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.780
Kirito-kun.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.300
Thank you, Leafa.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.760
I-It's nothing...

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.720
But don't do something so reckless.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.390
I'm fine on my own.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.560
I don't want to cause you any more trouble.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.390
Trouble?!

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.560
I...

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:57.560
Kirito-kun?

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.860
W-Wait!

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.280
Going alone is suicide!

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.280
That... may be so.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.780
It is! So—

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.410
But I have to go.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.410
Just...

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.120
Just stop already.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.790
Go back to being your usual self.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.090
I...

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:21.920
I...

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.630
Kirito-kun, I...

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.390
Leafa.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.020
Sorry.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.230
If I don't go there, nothing can end... or begin.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.940
I have to see her.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.730
Once more...

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.240
See Asuna again...

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.870
What...

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.830
What did you just say?

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.910
Yeah, Asuna...

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.420
That's the name of the person I'm looking for.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.590
But...

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.050
That means...

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.470
That means...

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.880
That person is...

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.940
Onii-chan, is that you?

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.400
Sugu?

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.070
Suguha?

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.160
This is cruel.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.330
It's just too much.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:35.290
This...

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.910
S-Sugu?

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:39.960
Sugu!

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.250
Sugu, can we talk?

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.750
Stop!

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.380
Don't come in.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.420
Give me some time alone.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.800
What's wrong, Sugu?

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.930
Well, I was surprised too.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.720
If you're mad that I used the
NerveGear again, I apologize.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.730
But there was no way around it.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.100
No.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.940
That's not it.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.190
That's not...

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:50.610
Sugu?

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.200
I...

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.750
betrayed my feelings!

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.750
I betrayed my love for you.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:09.630
To forget everything and give it all up,
I decided to love Kirito-kun instead.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.840
No... I already did!

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.720
But...

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.180
Despite that...

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.680
L-Love?

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.060
But we're...

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.140
I know.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.940
I know already!

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.190
The two of us aren't real siblings!

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.900
I've known about it for two years now.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:40.830
You quit kendo and started avoiding me because
you knew about it the whole time, right?

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.540
You were distancing yourself because
I'm not your real sister, right?!

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.210
So...

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.670
So why are you being nice to me now?!

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:57.180
I... was happy when you came back from SAO.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:03.140
You were nice to me like when we
were little, so I was really happy.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.520
I thought you were finally accepting me.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.690
I really did.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.400
But...

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.360
If this was going to happen, it'd have
been better if you stayed distant!

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.490
If you had...

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.950
I wouldn't have realized my feelings for you,

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.660
or been pained by those feelings
after learning about Asuna-san.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.920
I wouldn't have tried to forget about you
by falling in love with Kirito-kun either!

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.430
I'm sorry.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.390
Just... leave me alone.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.170
Sugu...

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:22.850
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:32.690
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.540
My endless feelings are lost
tomedonai omoi wa

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.130
in these ordinary days.
nichijou ni nomarete

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:58.300
They waver and change shape yet again.
yurameki nagara mata katachi wo kaeteitta

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.890
I wonder if I'm too late,
imasara mou osoi kana

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.350
but there's no answer in sight.
henji mo nai jimonjitou

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.350
Every decision is up to me,
subete wa sou jibun shidai

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.980
whether it's the beginning or the end.
owari mo hajimari mo

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.030
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands.
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:27.160
Flying towards the gentle light, I flap my wings.
yasashii hikari wo mezashite habatakuyo

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.250
I embrace the passion
kokoro ni tomoshita

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.460
that flared up in my heart
jounetsu mo daite

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:42.550
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
