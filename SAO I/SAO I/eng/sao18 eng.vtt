00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.690
<i>"I want to see the virtual world with my own eyes."</i>

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.820
<i>I wonder when I first thought that.</i>

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.870
<i>Initially,</i>

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.330
<i>I saw virtual reality games as detestable
creations that had stolen my brother from me.</i>

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.500
<i>Still, I...</i>

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.550
<i>ended up wanting to see the world that my brother loved so dearly for myself.</i>

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.090
<i>I grew curious.</i>

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.850
<i>Eventually,</i>

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.480
<i>I became completely absorbed by the world of Alfheim Online.</i>

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.570
<i>The thrill of soaring freely through the skies with your own wings...</i>

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.530
<i>If it meant that I could continue to fly as high and far as I desired,</i>

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.330
<i>nothing would be too big a sacrifice.</i>

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.170
<i>I think I understand now.</i>

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.960
<i>The reason why my brother was so enchanted by this world.</i>

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.840
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.270
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.820
Seeking but a miracle,
kiseki dake wo motome

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.990
I wander in the unrelenting darkness
kienai yami wo samayou

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:53.710
If I remain here, I'll only be trapped in the present.
doko ni ireba nidoto mirai miru koto dekinai

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.340
The moon beckons again tonight,
koyoi mo tsuki ga sasotte

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.050
and while I still can't voice my feelings,
mada kotoba dasenai kedo

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.850
I continue to scream inside my heart.
kokoro no naka sakebitsuzuketa

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.230
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.280
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.860
If only I could have become a little bit stronger,
ato honno sukoshi dake tsuyoku nareta nara

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.120
I would have flown far above these skies
me no mae ni aru kono sora koete yuku kara

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.210
and reached out to the future beyond here.
kono saki ni aru mirai ni te wo nobasu kara

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.610
Leafa-chan!

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.110
I told you not to call me that at school, Nagata-kun.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.870
S-Sorry, Suguha-chan.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.830
Why you...

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.160
S-S-Sorry, Kirigaya-san!

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.910
What do you want?

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.420
And why are you here when you've
already been accepted to a high school?

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.380
Attendance is voluntary at this point.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.000
Sugu—

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.170
Kirigaya-san, I had something to tell you, so I waited here all morning.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.890
Haven't you been accepted already, too?

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.970
I went to the kendo club because the advisor called for me.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.560
So, what is it that you wanted to tell me?

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.440
Sigurd and the others want to go hunting again this afternoon.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.530
Sorry, but I won't be able to join you guys for a while.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.820
H-Huh?

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.860
Why?

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.070
I'm planning to go to Alne for a bit.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.410
Alne? At the base of Yggdrasil...

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.160
W-Wait, are you going with
that Spriggan from yesterday?

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.580
Well...

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.670
Yeah, sort of.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.420
I'm just going to show him the way there.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.340
Wh-What are you thinking, Lea—

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.340
Kirigaya-san, you're going to travel that far

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.970
and sleep at inns with <i>that</i> shady guy?

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.890
Get your mind out of the gutter!

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.440
Anyway, that's how it is,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.730
so let Sigurd and the others know, okay?

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.150
See ya!

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.450
I'm just showing him the way there.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.160
That's all.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.190
Link Start!

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.120
Hey, you're early.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.460
No, I just got here.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.170
I was doing a bit of shopping.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.550
I need to get prepared too.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.050
This isn't very reliable, after all.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.340
Okay.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.510
Then let's go to the weapon store.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.680
How much money do you have?

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.350
Hm...

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.020
It's this "Yrd" thing, right?

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.940
Yeah.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.020
H-Hey,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.230
we're going, Yui.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.200
Okay...

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.890
Why are we at the tower?

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.140
Oh,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.020
when you're making long-distance flights, you need to take off from the top of here.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.690
It's for the extra altitude.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.850
So that's how it is.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.110
<i>Y-You're kidding me!</i>

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.450
Come on, let's go.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.950
I want to get past the forest before nightfall.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.370
Here, it's this way!

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.090
Leafa!

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.210
Good afternoon, Sigurd.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.550
Are you leaving the party, Leafa?

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.970
Yeah, pretty much.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.390
Didn't it occur to you that it would inconvenience the rest of us?

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.600
We agreed that whether or not I participate in the party

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.060
was completely up to me, remember?

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.780
But now, the fact that you're a
member of my party is well-known.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.740
If you leave without a good
reason, it'll reflect badly on us.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.410
Comrades aren't items, you know.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.420
What did you say?

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.720
I'm saying you can't keep other players permanently equipped to yourself

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.180
like your favorite sword or armor.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.260
Why you...

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.890
Garbage-rummaging Spriggans
 like you should know their place!

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.650
I bet you're just a renegade who
 was exiled from his own territory!

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.110
Watch what you say.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.570
Kirito-kun is my new partner!

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.070
What?

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.910
Leafa, do you intend to abandon your home territory and become a renegade too?!

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.660
Yes, that's right.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.160
I'm leaving this place!

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.290
I was going to leave you to crawl around like the little insect that you are,

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.040
but your thievery seems to be a death wish.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.920
Seeing as you nonchalantly waltzed into another race's territory,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.220
I'm assuming you'll have no
complaints if we cut you down.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.270
Now's not a good time, Sigurd-san.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.980
If you kill a defenseless player in front of all these people...

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.570
Damn.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.990
Run and hide as best as you can outside, Leafa.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.540
If you betray me now,

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.210
you'll surely come to regret it in the near future.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.630
Sorry for getting you involved in that mess.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.180
It's fine.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.970
But was that okay?

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.680
Abandoning your home territory...

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.900
H-Hey...

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.820
The view's incredible.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.530
The sky seems so close. It's like I could reach out and touch it.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.660
Right?

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.080
Whenever I see this sky, so many things look small in comparison.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.920
It was a good opportunity.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.380
I've always been thinking of leaving this place someday.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.510
I see.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.720
But it seems like I made it the result of a falling out between comrades.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.600
Either way, there wouldn't have been a peaceful alternative.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.270
Say, what's a "renegade"?

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.190
It's what we call players who've abandoned their territory.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.480
In other words, they're scorned as deserters.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.820
Are you fine with that?

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.700
Yeah, I don't really mind, but...

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.910
I wonder why people want to tie down themselves and others like that.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.910
Especially since we have these wings...

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.500
Humans are really complicated.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.250
I don't understand the mentality

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.010
that makes them express their longing for others in such a complicated way.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.590
Longing?

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.550
If it were me...

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.560
I'd do that.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.600
It's very simple and clear.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.770
Th-That's an amazing AI.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.440
Are all Private Pixies like that?

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.190
She's an especially odd one.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.030
I-I see.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.700
A longing for others, huh?

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.870
Leafa-chan!

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.120
Oh, Recon.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.160
You're so mean!

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.870
You could've at least said
something to me before you left.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.880
Sorry, I forgot.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.500
Leafa-chan, I heard you left the party.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.880
It was kind of on the spur of the moment though.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.300
What are you going to do?

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.470
Isn't that obvious?

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.470
I wield this blade for none other than you, after all.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.430
What? But I don't really need it.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.730
R-Regardless, that's how it is,

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.860
so naturally I'll be tagging along...

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.690
is what I'd like to say,

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.740
but there's something that I'm a little worried about.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.530
What is it?

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.620
I don't have any real evidence yet...

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.700
But I want to investigate a bit, so I'll stay in Sigurd's party for a while.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.410
Kirito-san,

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.960
she has a habit of getting into trouble, so please be careful.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.380
O-Okay, got it.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.050
Also, just so you know,

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.630
she's my—

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.350
We should be in the neutral region for a while,

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.350
so message me if something comes up.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.680
O-Ow...

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.990
He's your friend in real life too, right?

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.660
Yeah, I guess.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.950
Hm...

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.200
What's with that thoughtful look?

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.280
Nothing really.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.990
I was just thinking that it seems nice.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.170
I understand how he feels.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.090
He likes you, doesn't he?

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.920
What do you think of him?

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.880
I-It's not like it matters!

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.480
Come on, let's hurry!

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.190
We'll reach that lake in one flight!

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.440
Okay!

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.260
Honestly...

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.010
You're such an obstinate woman.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.680
It's just a fake body, you know.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.810
It won't hurt you.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.980
Don't you ever feel like having a little fun?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.520
You wouldn't understand.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.980
It doesn't matter whether or not this body is real.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.440
At least, not to me.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.400
Are you trying to say it would defile your heart?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.830
I think it'd be wise of you to learn how to have fun while you still can though.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.250
I don't plan on staying here forever.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.790
I'm sure...

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.960
<i>he'll</i> come to save me.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.170
Oh? Who will?

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.170
Is it who I think it is?

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.050
The hero, Kirito-kun.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.220
His...

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.890
real name is Kirigaya-kun, isn't it?

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.390
I met him the other day

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.680
in the real world.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.140
Honestly,

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.570
I couldn't believe the hero that cleared SAO was a mere child.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.900
Where do you think I met him?

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.860
In your hospital room!

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:23.790
The expression he made when I told him in front of your bed that I'd be marrying you next week

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.000
was just priceless!

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.580
I could barely contain my laughter!

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.500
Feel free to count on him,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.050
but that brat doesn't have the guts to put on the NerveGear ever again!

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.300
Oh, right.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.510
I need to send him an invitation to our wedding.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.020
He'll definitely come.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.430
To see you in a wedding dress, that is.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:52.270
I guess it's only fair to let Hero Boy have that much.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.860
Now then,

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.120
I have to leave you for a bit, Titania.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.700
I'm sure it'll be lonely, but please be patient.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.620
<i>Kirito-kun is...</i>

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.790
<i>Kirito-kun is...</i>

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.540
<i>alive!</i>

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.610
<i>8...</i>

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.070
<i>11...</i>

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.450
<i>3...</i>

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.740
<i>2...</i>

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.950
<i>9.</i>

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.640
Good work!

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.060
Thanks for the backup.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.070
Our wings are just about at their limit.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.780
Let's head down for a bit.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.820
Okay.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:29.950
Tired?

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.620
No, not really.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.420
Oh, well aren't you a hard worker?

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.340
But still, we'll have to put flying on hold for a while.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.170
What?

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.210
Why?

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.880
You can see that mountain, right?

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.260
It's taller than the height limit,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.350
so we need to go through the caves to get past.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:51.930
It's the roughest part of the trip from
 Sylph territory to Alne, or so I've heard.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.810
It'll be my first time going beyond here too.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.400
I see.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.690
Caves, huh?

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.610
Are they long?

00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:59.900
Considerably.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.240
There's supposedly a neutral mining town
 partway through that we can rest at though.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.320
Kirito-kun, do you have to leave soon?

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.990
It's 7 PM in the real world, huh?

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.750
I'll be fine for a while longer.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.500
Really?

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.580
Then let's continue for a bit longer.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.880
Why don't we rotate out here?

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.830
R-Rotate?

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:22.210
Oh, it means to take turns logging out and resting.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.090
We're in a neutral region, so we can't log off immediately.

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:29.930
Instead, people take turns protecting each other's avatar while they're off.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.930
I see. Sounds good.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.310
Leafa, you can go first.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.350
Okay, I'll take you up on that.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.060
Give me twenty minutes or so.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.840
Onii-chan, what do you want for dinner?

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.680
Maybe he's asleep.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.330
<i>I'm...</i>

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.990
<i>excited.</i>

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.010
<i>Kirito-kun...</i>

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.470
<i>It's not that I've come to like him,</i>

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.850
<i>nor is it because I now have a partner to adventure with.</i>

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:58.190
<i>It's just that I'm looking forward to exploring a new world.</i>

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:11.700
Thanks for waiting.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.950
See any monsters?

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.790
Welcome back.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.000
Things were pretty uneventful.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.120
What's that?

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.790
Just something I bought at the general store before we left.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:25.090
The NPC there said it's a Swilvane specialty.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.920
I've never heard of that before.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.480
Well then, guess it's my turn to log off now.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.900
I'll be counting on you.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.980
Yeah, go on ahead.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.000
Y-You can move even while your master's offline?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.290
Well of course I can.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.420
I'm me, after all.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.510
And he's not my master. He's Papa.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.510
That reminds me...

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.760
Why do you call Kirito-kun, "Papa"?

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.060
Don't tell me he... asked you to do that?

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.900
I owe my life to Papa.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.860
He told me, "You're my child."

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.150
That's why he's my Papa.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.240
I-I see.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.570
Do you like... Papa?

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.660
Leafa-san, what does it mean to like someone?

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.710
W-Well...

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.670
Always wanting to be with them,

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.000
and feeling giddy and excited when you're together...

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.840
I guess it's that sort of feeling.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.180
What's wrong, Leafa-san?

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.800
I-I-It's nothing!

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.350
What's nothing exactly?

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.430
I'm back.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:01.770
Did something happen?

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.480
Welcome back, Papa.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.310
I was just talking with Leafa-san.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.190
About wh—

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.520
I'm telling you, it's nothing!

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.940
Th-That was pretty quick.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.740
Did you eat and everything?

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.570
Yeah, my family left me something to eat.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.660
Oh.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.950
Then let's get going now.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.250
R-Right.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.960
Off we go then.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.750
Something wrong?

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.210
Well...

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.170
I get the feeling someone's watching us.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.510
Yui, are there any players nearby?

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.840
No, I don't detect anyone.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.430
Hmm, it might be a Tracer following us.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.810
What's that?

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.310
It's tracking magic.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.810
It generally appears as a small familiar

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.060
and reports the location of a target to its caster.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.770
Can we dispel it or something?

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.190
It's possible if we manage to find it,

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.150
but the higher the caster's magic skill,

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.780
the greater the Tracer's area of effect.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.280
So in a field like this, it'll be
 practically impossible to locate.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.160
I see. Well, it could just be my imagination.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.040
Anyway, let's get a move on.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.000
Okay.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:22.850
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:32.690
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.540
My endless feelings are lost
tomedonai omoi wa

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.130
in these ordinary days.
nichijou ni nomarete

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:58.300
They waver and change shape yet again.
yurameki nagara mata katachi wo kaeteitta

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.890
I wonder if I'm too late,
imasara mou osoi kana

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.350
but there's no answer in sight.
henji mo nai jimonjitou

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.350
Every decision is up to me,
subete wa sou jibun shidai

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.980
whether it's the beginning or the end.
owari mo hajimari mo

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.030
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands.
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:27.160
Flying towards the gentle light, I flap my wings.
yasashii hikari wo mezashite habatakuyo

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.250
I embrace the passion
kokoro ni tomoshita

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.460
that flared up in my heart
jounetsu mo daite

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:42.550
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara
