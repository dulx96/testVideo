WEBVTT

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.600
Here's to us, the Black Cats of the Full Moon!

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.560
Cheers!

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.570
And here's to Kirito-san, our savior!

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.530
Cheers!

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.030
Ch-Cheers...

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.030
Thanks.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.620
Thank you.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.580
You saved our hides.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.540
Thank you.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.830
Thank you so much.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.250
Don't worry about it.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.920
I was really scared,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.090
so I honestly felt relieved when you came to save me.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.380
O-Oh...

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.210
Um, Kirito-san...

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.510
I realize this is prying,

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.260
but mind telling us your level?

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.300
Around Level 20.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.430
Wow, that's pretty close to ours.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.930
I'm amazed that you survived on your own.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.850
Keita, don't be so polite.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.310
Solo players like me just target lone mobs.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.570
It's inefficient.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.570
O-Oh... I see.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.740
In that case, Kirito, I know it's a bad time to ask,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.320
but how about joining our guild?

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.330
Tetsuo's the only one that can act as a vanguard since he's a mace user.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.910
This girl's name is Sachi.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.250
I'm planning to have her switch to using a sword and a shield so she can also be a vanguard.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.340
Problem is, she doesn't really know what to do.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.840
Mind coaching her a bit?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.590
Quit belittling me.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.350
I mean, it's natural to be scared when you're thrown into a close combat role all of a sudden.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.940
Don't sweat it. You can just hide behind your shield.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.270
Jeez. You've always been such a scaredy-cat.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.860
Hmph.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.360
Everyone here is a member of our school's PC Research Club.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.620
Oh, but don't worry about that.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.240
You'll fit right in. No doubt about it.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.000
Right?

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.090
Then...

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.920
I think I'll accept.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.300
Thanks.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.010
My name's Sasamori.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.220
Nice to meet'cha.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.970
Let's do our best together!
Nice to meet'cha.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.070
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:28.000
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.800
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.100
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.350
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.070
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.200
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.660
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.790
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.460
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.300
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.470
I wanna always be with you.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.480
I'll give you everything I have.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.980
The Red-Nosed Reindeer

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.790
Sachi, step back.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.300
Tetsuo, switch!

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.550
Right!

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.720
All right!

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.310
Awesome!

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.180
Cool.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.810
Congrats!

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.940
You did it!

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.940
So the clearing group made it past the 28th Floor, huh?

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.860
Amazing.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.990
Hey, Kirito.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.990
What do you think's the difference
 between us and the clearing group?

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.490
Information, maybe?

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.370
They monopolize the most efficient training spots and the like.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.790
I'm sure that's partly it,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.170
but I think a major factor is willpower.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.460
Willpower?

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.930
I guess you could call it the determination to
protect your friends—or rather, all the players.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.390
Right now, even though we're the ones being protected,

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.180
I'd like to believe my determination is just as strong.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.060
Of course, the safety of my friends is my top priority.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.940
However...

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.150
Someday, I hope we'll all be able to join the clearing group.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.940
I see.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.070
You have a point.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.280
Maybe...

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.990
Yo, leader.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.160
Nice speech!

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.030
Watch it.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.660
So we're gonna be comrades with the Divine Dragon Alliance and the Knights of Blood?

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.040
Is that a problem?

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.170
Let's aim high.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.550
First, we'll all hit Level 30.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.130
No way!

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.380
<i>If the Black Cats improve and make it to the front lines,</i>

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.930
<i>Keita's ideals could change the unsociable atmosphere there.</i>

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.600
I have some news for you all

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.110
Including the spoils of the last hunt,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.070
we've accumulated 200,000 Col!

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.820
Pretty soon, buying our own house will no longer be a dream!

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.120
I know, how about we get Sachi some new equipment?

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.330
Sounds good.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.660
No, I'm fine with what I have now.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.420
Don't be so reserved.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.630
We can't make Kirito be the vanguard forever.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.630
Sorry.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.670
I don't mind.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.800
Don't worry about it.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.630
Sorry, Kirito.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.260
Sachi, I know it's hard switching jobs,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
but you've almost got it.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.510
Let's all do our best!

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.520
Yeah.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.240
Klein...

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.180
Well, if it isn't Kirito!

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.140
Guys, I'll leave the mobs to you.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.180
Okay.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.180
I haven't seen you around lately.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.430
You've been training this late at night?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.480
Hey, that mark...

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.150
Did you join a guild?

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.730
Yeah, sorta.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.530
Hey, whenever you're ready!

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.280
See ya.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.910
Yeah.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.620
Good grief...

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.290
You're still worrying about before?

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.300
<i>"This is Keita.</i>

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.260
<i>Sachi went out and hasn't returned.</i>

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.430
<i>We'll go look for her in the dungeon area.</i>

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.260
<i>If you figure something out, let me know."</i>

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.060
Sachi...

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.290
Sachi!

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.120
Kirito?

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.040
Everyone's worried.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.420
Hey, Kirito.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.260
Let's run away together.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Run away? From what?

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.730
From this town, the monsters,

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.770
the Black Cats...

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.360
and Sword Art Online.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.780
A-Are you suggesting a double suicide?

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.320
That might be good.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.240
No, I'm sorry.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.490
That was a lie.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.410
If I was prepared to die,

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.040
I wouldn't be hiding in the safety of this town, right?

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.080
Say, why can't we leave?

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.090
Why is our life at stake when it's only a game?

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.220
What's the point?

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.260
There's probably no meaning to it.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.180
I think...

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.100
I'm afraid of dying.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.320
You're afraid of dying?

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.780
I'm so scared, I haven't been able to sleep lately.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.530
You won't die.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.080
Really?

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.620
How can you be so sure?

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.710
The Black Cats is by no means a weak guild.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.880
We're also taking extra
precautions in ascending floors.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.550
Moreover, Tetsuo and I are here,

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.470
so there's no need for you to fight as a vanguard.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.180
Will I really survive?

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.260
Can I go back to the real world someday?

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.510
Yeah.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.270
You'll survive.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.730
This game won't be the end of you.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:12.540
Come in.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.120
Sorry.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.250
I still can't sleep.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.460
<i>If you stay in this guild, you'll be safe.</i>

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.050
<i>You'll definitely be able to go back to the real world someday.</i>

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.890
<i>I'm sure there are many players like Sachi who fear death.</i>

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:37.690
<i>Even so, they laugh, cry, and survive in this world to the best of their ability.</i>

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.190
<i>I've never really thought about it...</i>

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.650
Kirito?

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.900
It's okay.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.030
You're definitely going to survive.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.580
<i>I'll protect all of you no matter what.</i>

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.170
Well then, I'll be right back.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.300
Teleport to Starting Town.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.930
I didn't know it'd be this exciting buying our own house.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.510
That's something an old man would say!

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:22.310
Hey, let's go make some cash while Keita's off buying the house.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.110
Oh, for furniture?

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.320
Then how about going to one of the upper dungeons?

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.860
Wouldn't our usual hunting spots be better?

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.620
It'd be more efficient in the upper dungeons.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.870
At our levels, we'll be fine.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.460
See? This is no problem for us.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.540
Just a bit more and we might make it to the front lines.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.300
You said it!

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.430
<i>A hidden door? Here?</i>

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.640
It's a treasure chest!

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.770
W-Wait!

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.370
It's a trap!

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.290
Guys, we need to get out of here!

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.830
Teleport to Taft!

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.750
Teleport to Taft!

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.340
The crystals aren't working!

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.920
So this is an Anti-Crystal Area?

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.730
Tetsuo!

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.440
Dammit!

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.630
Sachi!

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.500
Kirito!

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.670
Sachi!

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.670
Seems like you've been doin' some pretty intense training lately.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.420
Do you have any new information?

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.210
Nothin' worth charging for.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.550
Some information broker you are...

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.930
This is a new event that wasn't in the beta.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.010
There's no credible source of information.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.970
On Christmas Eve, which is at midnight,

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.730
the event boss, Nicholas the Renegade, will spawn.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.440
Right underneath a certain fir tree.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.110
Even the big guilds are in a frenzy searchin' for it.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.990
You've got an idea where it is, dont'cha?

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.070
Maybe.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.580
You seriously gonna try to solo it?

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.630
<i>In this world, resurrection is impossible.</i>

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.760
<i>However, Nicholas the Renegade...</i>

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.760
<i>is rumored to drop an item that can defy this rule.</i>

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.350
<i>If I face it alone, I'll probably...</i>

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.640
<i>die.</i>

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.650
<i>In a place where no one can see me,</i>

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.400
<i>I'll die meaninglessly.</i>

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.980
<i>A beater like you...</i>

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.440
<i>didn't have the right to be with us!</i>

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.210
<i>That's right...</i>

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.790
<i>I...</i>

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.750
<i>My arrogance...</i>

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.130
<i>killed all of you.</i>

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.630
<i>If only I...</i>

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.090
<i>hadn't kept my level a secret.</i>

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.520
<i>If I manage to defeat Nicholas...</i>

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.850
<i>Sachi can be resurrected</i>

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.320
<i>and I'll be able to hear her last words.</i>

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.950
<i>No matter what curses she may have for me,</i>

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.620
<i>I'll have to accept them.</i>

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.340
Yo.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.920
You followed me?

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.260
Pretty much.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.720
Are you after the resurrection item?

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.930
Yeah.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.430
Don't risk your life for something that might be a sham.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.140
This survival game isn't a joke.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.480
The moment our HP drops to zero,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.150
our brains in the real world—

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.270
Zip it.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.360
Trying to solo it is crazy!

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.990
Fight with us.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.450
Whoever gets the resurrection item can keep it, no hard feelings.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.990
That's fair, right?

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.620
If I did that... there'd be no point.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.000
I have to do it alone.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.750
Listen...

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.000
I can't let you die here,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.130
Kirito!

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.970
It appears you were followed too, Klein.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:49.930
Looks like it.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.430
The Divine Dragon Alliance?

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.730
They'll do <i>anything</i> for a rare item.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.150
What should we do?

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.270
I...

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.820
Goddammit!

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.610
Go, Kirito!

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:05.200
Klein...

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.410
Go!

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.410
We'll hold these guys back!

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.330
Can it.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.810
Kirito!

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.900
H-Hey...

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.030
That's the resurrection item.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.370
Lemme see.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.870
"The target player...

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.200
within ten seconds"?

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.790
Do whatever you want with it.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.930
Kirito...

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.560
Kirito!

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.230
You... You have to survive!

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.020
Survive until the end. Please...

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.030
See ya.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.760
Sachi?

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.770
Merry Christmas, Kirito.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.990
By the time you hear this,

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.740
I'll probably be dead.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.320
How should I put it...

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.240
You know, the truth is,

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.790
I never wanted to leave Starting Town.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.670
But if I fought with thoughts like that,

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.340
I knew I'd definitely die someday.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.380
That in itself is nobody's fault,

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.170
but mine alone.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.800
Ever since that night, you continued to assure me

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.390
that I would definitely survive.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:23.310
So if I died, I'm sure you would try to place all the blame on yourself.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.190
That's why I decided to leave this recording behind.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:32.320
And also, I actually know what level you are.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.030
I caught a glimpse of it before.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.950
Even though I thought long and hard about why

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.750
you hid your level and joined us, I never did figure it out.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:51.260
But you know, when I learned how strong you were, I was glad.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.430
I was really relieved.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.720
So... even if I die,

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.220
work hard to survive, okay?

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.350
Live to see the end of this world,

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.230
find the meaning behind its creation,

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:06.150
the meaning behind the presence of a weak girl like me,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:11.230
and the meaning behind our meeting.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.320
That's my last wish.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.780
There's still some time left.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.330
Since it's Christmas, how about a song?

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.150
Bye, Kirito.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.200
Meeting you...

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.410
and being together with you...

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:01.950
I don't regret it all.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.040
Thank you.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.330
Farewell.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:39.610
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:51.420
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.420 --> 00:23:03.220
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:13.820
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:24.870
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:37.460
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:44.260
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
