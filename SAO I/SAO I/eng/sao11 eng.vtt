WEBVTT

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.060
I understand the situation.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.180
I'll explain it to the rest of the guild.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.020
That aside, we'd like to request a temporary leave from the guild.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.860
And for what reason?

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.910
I feel uneasy about the current Knights of the Blood.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.950
Very well.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.460
However,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.380
I'm sure you'll return to the battlefield before long.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.770
What a great view!

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.690
Don't lean out too far or you'll fall off.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.620
We found a nice house.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.790
It cost us all of our savings though.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.290
But here, we can live in peace.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.170
Kirito-kun,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840
what's wrong?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.260
Say, Asuna...

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.310
do you think our relationship is limited to this world?

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.270
Don't make me angry, Kirito-kun.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.730
Even if this is just a virtual world,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.520
my feelings are real.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.610
If I've learned anything here,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.490
it's to never give up and persevere until the very end.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.120
If we manage to return to the real world,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.450
I'll surely find you once more

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.910
and fall in love all over again.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.100
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.030
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:25.830
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.130
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.380
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.100
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.230
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.690
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.820
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.490
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.330
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.500
I wanna always be with you.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.510
I'll give you everything I have.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.820
<i>Even though he's usually bold,</i>

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.570
<i>he looks surprisingly naïve now—</i>

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.070
<i>maybe even childish.</i>

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.240
<i>He can't be younger than me, right?</i>

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.790
Kirito-kun...

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.010
I love you.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.510
Let's stay together forever.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.310
Morning, Kirito-kun.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.980
Morning.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.280
D-Did you hear that?

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.570
Hear what?

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.860
O-Oh, it's nothing!

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.580
Well then, where should we spend the day today?

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.660
You know...

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.130
We've just been having fun for the past three days, haven't we?

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.220
So, Kirito-kun, you don't want to have fun?

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.430
Oh,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.140
I know where we could go.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.060
So, where are we headed?

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.020
Let's save it as a surprise.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.070
Hey, let me ride on your shoulders!

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.030
R-Ride?

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.490
I mean, it's no fun seeing things from the same height all the time.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.250
With your STR parameter,
it should be a piece of cake, right?

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.540
W-Well that's true, but...

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.170
That's something kids would do.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.260
Age has nothing to do with it.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.180
Come on, it's not like anyone's watching.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.100
F-Fine, I guess.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.730
If you turn around, I'll slap you. Got it?

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.020
Don't you think you're being a bit unreasonable?

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.440
I'm ready.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.870
Look, you can already see the lake from here.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.540
<i>I can't see it...</i>

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.460
Then I'll do the same for you later.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.420
Now, off we go!

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.260
Heading: north-northeast!

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.590
Yes, ma'am.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.810
That surprised me.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.730
So there <i>are people watching...</i>

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.690
I guess so...

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.280
Come on, Kirito-kun, you wave too.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.120
Not in a million years.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.080
Should I get down?

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.880
Hold on tight!

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.550
This is just a rumor I heard in the village yesterday, but...

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.810
around here, deep in the forest, apparently you can see things.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.060
Huh? Like what?

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.560
Ghosts.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.770
A-Are you referring to...

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.230
astral-type monsters?

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.110
No, far from it.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.320
They're real.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.530
The grudges of all the slain monsters...

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.910
supposedly haunt this field at night.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.050
And we're almost there.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.130
To the rumored spot?

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.090
About a week ago,

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.100
a woodcrafting player came here looking for wood.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.770
While he was busy gathering, it got dark...

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:54.060
And behind a nearby tree, there was something white...

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.450
Whether it was a monster or something else is unknown...

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.660
The white shadow slowly walked to the other side of the grove...

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.750
H-H-H-H-Hey!

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.710
P-P-P-Put me down!

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.050
What's wrong?

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.350
Ki-Kirito-kun, over there...

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.100
What is it?

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.610
You've gotta be kidding me...

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.580
That's...

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.080
It's not a ghost!

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.840
W-W-Wait, Kirito-kun!

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.500
Jeez!

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.470
A-A player?

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.720
This is pretty strange.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.230
Strange?

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.940
I don't see a cursor.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.570
Think it's a bug?

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.860
Probably.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.610
Why is... a small girl like her in SAO?

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.290
At any rate, we can't just leave her here.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.910
Once she wakes up, we can probably figure this out.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.670
Let's take her home.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.540
Yeah, sounds good.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.180
Well, we know one thing for sure now.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.220
Seeing how we were able to bring her home,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.930
she can't be an NPC.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.430
That's true.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:59.520
If she was an NPC, when you picked her up, a harrassment notice would've appeared.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.320
She can't be a quest trigger either.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.570
If she was, the quest log window would've been updated.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:14.160
Which means she really <i>is a player who got lost there...</i>

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.250
Or at least, that's the most plausible scenario.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.540
But... why was she there?

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:25.300
I wouldn't know the circumstances, but maybe she has a parent or guardian that was with her?

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.760
Yeah, she probably logged in together with her family.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.260
I hope they're okay.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.350
Hey, she'll wake up, right?

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.150
Yeah. Seeing as her body's still here,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.650
the NerveGear must still be communicating with her.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.900
I think she's in a sleep-like state.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.820
So I'm sure she'll... wake up eventually.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.580
Hey, Kirito-kun.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.340
Jeez...

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.060
<i>If...</i>

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.940
<i>If she logged into SAO all by herself...</i>

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.320
<i>she must've been alone all this time...</i>

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.450
Good night.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.660
I hope you wake up tomorrow.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.560
Ki-Kirito-kun!

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.350
Kirito-kun, over here!

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.480
Morning...

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.480
Something wrong?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.360
Quick, come over here!

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.650
Thank goodness, you woke up.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.570
Do you remember what happened to you?

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.080
I see...

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.250
How about your name?

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.000
Can you tell me?

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.790
N-Name...

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.590
My name...

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.090
Yu-i?

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.350
Yui. That's... my name.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.260
Yui-chan, huh?

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.720
What a nice name.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.890
I'm Asuna.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.190
And this is Kirito.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.770
A-una?

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.480
Ki-to?

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.030
Say, Yui-chan, why were you in the forest?

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.530
Do you know where your father and mother are?

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.040
I dunno...

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.040
I dunno anything...

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.210
That's...

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.710
Hey, Yui-chan.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.220
Can I call you "Yui"?

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:19.100
All right. Then you can call me "Kirito".

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.600
Ki-to?

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.100
It's Kirito.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.060
Ki-ri-to.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.860
Ki-hi-to.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.400
Maybe it's a bit too difficult.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.900
You can call me by whatever comes naturally.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.570
Papa.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.160
M-Me?

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.830
Auna is Mama.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.050
That's right.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.720
I'm Mama, Yui-chan!

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.130
Mama!

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.140
Papa! Mama!

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.470
You're hungry, aren't you?

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.600
Let's have breakfast.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.110
Here, Yui-chan, this is for you.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.080
You know, Yui, this is <i>very spicy.</i>

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.420
I want the same one as Papa.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.790
I see.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.670
If you're up for the challenge, I won't stop you.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.590
Everything is an experience.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.270
Yummy...

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.900
She's a pretty gutsy girl.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.280
Let's go for a super-spicy, full course dinner tonight.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.280
Jeez, don't get carried away.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.820
I'm not cooking something like that.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.030
You heard her.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.550
Hey, Kirito-kun, what do you think?

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.180
She doesn't... seem to remember anything.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.760
But that aside, from the look of things...

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.350
She's just like a baby...

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.020
I... I...

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.860
Sorry. I don't know what I should do...

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.820
You want to look after Yui

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.490
until her memories return, right?

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.070
Yeah, but...

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.990
It's quite the dilemma.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.950
If we don't get back to clearing,

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.250
it'll take that much longer for Yui to be free.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:51.960
Yeah.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.300
Anyways, let's do what we can now.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.550
Judging from her gear,

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.680
it's hard to imagine she's been in the fields every day.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.220
First, we should go to the Starting Town

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.510
to search for her parents or siblings.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.180
You're right.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.980
I don't want to part with Yui either.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.770
Kirito-kun...

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.440
How should I put it...

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.240
It's been short, but the time we've spent with Yui here

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.910
made it seem like this was a real home...

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.700
That's how I truly feel.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.700
Yeah.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.080
But it's not like we'll never be able to see her again.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.840
Besides, if she has a family or a guardian, they're probably worried sick.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.010
Yeah. Once she wakes up, let's go to the Starting Town.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.220
Just in case,

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.840
be prepared to arm yourself at any time.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.720
That place is the Army's territory, after all.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.470
It would be best to keep our guard up.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.350
Mama...

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.310
Papa...

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.650
It's been a while since I've last been here.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.070
Me too.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.960
Hey, Yui-chan.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.080
Do any of these buildings look familiar?

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.380
Not really.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.920
Well, the Starting Town is frighteningly large, after all.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.590
For starters, let's head over to the central marketplace.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.350
Say, Kirito-kun...

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.520
Around how many players are here now?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.560
Hm, let's see...

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.610
The remaining players in SAO number at around 6,000.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:46.700
Including the Army, around 30% of them should be in the Starting Town, so...

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.570
Maybe a bit short of 2,000 people?

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.490
Considering that, isn't this place a little deserted?

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.910
You're right...

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.370
Return the children!

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.090
Oh, their babysitter showed up.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.050
Hello! We've been waiting for you!

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.760
Please, return the children!

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.760
Can you not make it sound like we're the bad guys here?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.720
We were just showing these kids how things work around here.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.640
This is also an important part of the Army's duty.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.690
Exactly.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.150
Citizens have a duty to pay taxes, after all.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.860
Gin! Kain! Mina!

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.400
Are you there?!

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.820
Sasha-sensei!

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.740
Sensei, help us!

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.330
Don't worry about the money, just hand it all over to them!

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.580
Sensei, it won't be enough.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.000
You lot have built up quite a sum to pay off as it is.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.670
We need you to give up your equipment as well,

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.550
including all your armor.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.050
Everything you have.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.720
Get...

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.680
Get out of my way!

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.560
Or else...

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.820
Everything's all right now.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.360
Take back your equipment.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.410
Hey.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.580
What the hell?

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.370
Who the heck are you guys?

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.040
Are you going to obstruct the duties of us, soldiers of the Army?!

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.080
Whatever, give me a second.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.460
I haven't seen you two around these parts, but...

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.220
you <i>do know what it means to obstruct the Liberation Army, don't you?!</i>

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.300
Kirito-kun, take care of Yui-chan.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.350
Right.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.160
Don't worry.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.080
In a safe zone, no matter what happens, your HP won't drop.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.460
Yes, there's only a light knockback effect.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.430
But regardless, fights in safe zones can carve fear into people.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.760
S-Stop it!

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.560
M-Men! Don't just stand there. Do something!

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.960
Whoa.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.420
That was amazing, Miss!

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.180
I've never seen anything like it!

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.050
Yeah, you were so cool!

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.060
Thank you very much.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.980
You're the coolest! Thank you!

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.020
I wish I could do that too!

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.860
Well? Mama's super strong, right?

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.690
Everyone's...

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.570
Everyone's hearts...

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.120
Yui?

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.830
Yui-chan?

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.160
Everyone's hearts...
Yui, what's wrong?

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.290
Yui?

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:28.000
Yui-chan, did you remember something?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.750
I... I...

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:35.340
I wasn't here...

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.930
I was always alone, in a dark place...

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.070
Yui!

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.490
Mama...

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.820
I'm scared, Mama...

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.160
What... was that?

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.920
Yui-chan...

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:39.610
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:51.420
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.420 --> 00:23:03.220
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:13.820
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:24.870
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:37.460
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:44.260
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
