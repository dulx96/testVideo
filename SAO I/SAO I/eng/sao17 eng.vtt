WEBVTT

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.460
So what'll it be?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.420
Are you going to fight too?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.840
I'll pass.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.510
My magic skill is just about to hit 900.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.010
I'd rather avoid the death penalty.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.300
You're an honest guy.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.680
And what about you, miss?

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.970
I'm finished too.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.600
Next time, I'll be sure to settle the score.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.350
I wouldn't want to face you one-on-one either.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.910
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.330
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.890
Seeking but a miracle,
kiseki dake wo motome

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.060
I wander in the unrelenting darkness
kienai yami wo samayou

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:33.780
If I remain here, I'll only be trapped in the present.
doko ni ireba nidoto mirai miru koto dekinai

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.400
The moon beckons again tonight,
koyoi mo tsuki ga sasotte

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.120
and while I still can't voice my feelings,
mada kotoba dasenai kedo

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.910
I continue to scream inside my heart.
kokoro no naka sakebitsuzuketa

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.290
These feelings I had buried are crying out.
kakushiteta kanjou ga himei wo ageteru

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.340
I'll hold on to these steadfast vows.
tashikana chikai wo te ni

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.930
If only I could have become a little bit stronger,
ato honno sukoshi dake tsuyoku nareta nara

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.180
I would have flown far above these skies
me no mae ni aru kono sora koete yuku kara

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.280
and reached out to the future beyond here.
kono saki ni aru mirai ni te wo nobasu kara

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.450
Hey, what's with these flames?

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.960
Shush, they're Remain Lights.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.630
They're still conscious of their surroundings.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.760
So, what should I do now?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.300
Thank you? Run away?

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.260
Or perhaps, fight you?

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.480
Well, I was expecting a "valiant knight saved the princess" kind of scene.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.430
Huh?

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.560
With you running into my arms
shedding tears of relief, for example.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.980
Are you retarded?!

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.150
It was just a joke.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.030
Of course!

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.950
That would be unacceptable!

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.860
Hey! I told you not to come out—

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.620
The only people who are allowed to cling to Papa are Mama and me!

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.450
P-Papa?!

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.080
Oh, well, y'see...

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.380
Say, is that one of those "private pixies"?

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.380
Y-Yeah. Something along those lines.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.300
Okay, that aside,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.930
why is a Spriggan like you wandering around here?

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.260
I-I got lost.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.850
Isn't your territory all the way in the east?

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.560
Your sense of direction is unbelievably bad.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.110
You're such a weirdo.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.240
Well, at any rate, you have my thanks.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.990
Thanks for saving me.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.990
My name's Leafa.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.370
I'm Kirito.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.290
And this is Yui.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.750
Say, Kirito...-kun,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.250
what are you going to do now?

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.920
If you'd like, um...

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.880
I'll treat you to a drink as thanks.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.430
Well?

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.140
That sounds great!

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.350
I was actually looking for someone who could help answer a few questions.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.720
Like what?

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.600
Things about this world.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.940
And that tree in particular.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.850
That tree?

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.900
You mean Yggdrasil?

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.270
Sure.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.650
I may not look it, but I've been around for a while.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.160
Okay, it's a bit far,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.490
but there's a neutral village north of here, so let's fly over there.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.240
Huh?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.950
But isn't the town called Swilvane closer?

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.330
You really don't know anything, do you?

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.460
That's Sylph territory.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.170
So?

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.380
Inside their territory, you won't be able to attack them,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.800
while they're free to attack you.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.970
But it's not like they're all going to attack me on sight, right?

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.300
And I have you with me, Leafa-san.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.770
Just call me "Leafa."

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.310
If you insist, I don't mind,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.770
but I can't guarantee your safety.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.690
All right, let's go.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.030
Huh?

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.950
Leafa, you don't need to use the support controller to fly?

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.820
Nope.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.780
What about you?

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.700
I just got the hang of using this a little while ago, so...

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.750
Well, flying without one <i>is</i> a bit tricky.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.960
Turn around without taking out the controller.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.330
O-Okay.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.710
Feel the spot where I'm touching?

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.460
Yeah.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.050
Imagine that there are virtual bones and muscles spreading out from here

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.010
and try to move them.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.760
Virtual bones and muscles...

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.220
Yeah, you got it!

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.190
Just like that.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.650
Now do the same thing, but with bigger movements.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.000
Oh no!

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.290
Papa!

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.330
Kirito-kun, you okay?

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.140
Make it stop!

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.350
I'm sorry, Papa!

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.890
It's too funny.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.530
This is great.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.990
I know, right?

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.120
Looks like you have a knack for this.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.830
Now then, follow me.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.540
Okay.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.370
We can take it slow at first.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.250
Feel free to pick up the pace.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.020
Is this the fastest you can go?

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.310
You asked for it.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.700
I can't go on...

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.880
You just might be the first person who can keep up with me.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.890
We're here.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.140
We'll land at the base of the central tower.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.440
Kirito-kun, do you know how to land?

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.940
No, I don't...

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.360
Um...

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.780
Sorry!

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.320
It's too late.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.530
I wish you luck.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.330
Y-You're kidding me!

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.870
What the...?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.090
That was cruel, Leafa.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.340
Sorry. I'll heal you.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.970
Wow, so this is magic?

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.520
You can't use high-level healing magic unless you're an Undine,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.690
but it's an indispensable spell, so you should learn it.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.650
So there are race-specific bonuses?

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.150
What are Spriggans good at?

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.450
Treasure hunting and illusion magic, I guess.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.160
But neither of them are any help in battle.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.000
So this is a Sylph town.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.210
It's a beautiful place.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.590
Right?

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.180
Leafa-chan!

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.680
Are you okay?

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.140
Oh, Recon.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.930
I knew you'd make it, Leafa-chan.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.680
What?!

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.100
A Spriggan?!

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.310
Oh, don't mind him.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.860
He's the one who saved me.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.270
This is Recon,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.940
my friend.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.990
Hi there,

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.200
I'm Kirito.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.610
Oh, nice to meet you.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.200
No.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.160
No, no, no!

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.530
That's not right.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.660
You sure about this?

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.830
He could be a spy or something.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:34.960
No need to worry.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.460
He's too much of an airhead to be a spy, after all.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.840
Wow, that's harsh.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.340
Sigurd and the others are saving you a seat at the usual bar.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.090
Oh, I see.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.550
I'll pass for today.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.140
Huh?

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.010
You're not coming?

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:52.970
Sorry,

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.560
but I owe Kirito-kun a drink for saving me.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.940
Well then, see you around.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.110
H-Hey, wait...

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.860
Leafa-chan...

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.620
Was that guy your boyfriend?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.120
Is he your lover?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.790
Huh? N-No way!

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.420
He's just someone I'm partying with.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.880
You two seem pretty close though.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.760
He's someone I know in real life.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.340
We're in the same grade at school

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.890
but that's all.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.230
Well, moving on,

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.890
thanks for saving me.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.610
Those guys were seriously aggressive.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.900
Are group PK hunts like that common?

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.530
Well, Salamanders and Sylphs have bad relations to begin with.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.790
But organized PKs like that one have only started to happen recently.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.120
I'm pretty sure they're aiming to reach the pinnacle of Yggdrasil in the near future.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.000
About that,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.540
I'd like you to tell me everything you know about Yggdrasil.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.800
Oh right, you mentioned that earlier, didn't you?

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.840
But why?

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.300
I want to get to the top of it.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.850
I think that goes for just about any player.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.100
After all, it's ALO's grand quest.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.730
Meaning?

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.400
You know how there's a flight duration limit, right?

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:26.070
No matter the race, ten minutes is the limit for continuous flight.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.570
However,

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.910
the first race to reach the Floating City above Yggdrasil

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.990
and have an audience with Oberon, the Fairy King,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.790
can be reborn as a more advanced race called Alf.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.080
Then, they'll be able to fly freely in the sky for as long as they want.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.580
I see.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.170
That <i>does</i> sound pretty appealing.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.970
So how can someone get to the top of Yggdrasil?

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.590
There's a large dome at its base

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.260
and you can reach the Floating City from there,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.680
but the NPCs guarding the dome are ridiculously powerful.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.560
Really?

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.600
Do you think it makes sense for there to be

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.400
a quest that hasn't been cleared,
even a year after the game started?

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.570
Either a key quest was overlooked

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.530
or it's designed to be impossible to
overcome at the hands of a single race.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:15.780
Oh?

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.280
You have good intuition.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.410
Everyone's checking to see if there's a quest that's been overlooked.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.920
But if it's the latter, we'd have to give up.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.290
Give up?

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.000
I mean, it'd be contradictory.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.760
Why would you cooperate with another race to clear a quest

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.840
that only one race could benefit from?

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:40.810
So, is it actually impossible to
ascend to the top of Yggdrasil?

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.190
That's what I think.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.400
But it's still hard to give up on it,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.070
especially after you experience the thrill of flying,

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.030
Even if it takes years, I'm sure—

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.490
It'd be too late then!

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.790
Papa?

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.500
Sorry.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.460
But I really have to get to the top of Yggdrasil.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.670
Why's that?

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.180
I'm looking for someone.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.760
What do you mean?

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.970
It's hard to explain.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.650
Thanks, Leafa.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.690
The information you've given me will come in handy.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.740
Wait.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.660
Are you planning to go to Yggdrasil?

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.200
Yeah,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.660
I have to see it for myself.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.670
That's reckless...

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.710
It's really far away,

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.010
and there'll be a ton of strong monsters along the way.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.880
Sure, you're strong too, but...

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.930
Fine, I'll take you there then!

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.610
But I can't make someone I just met do so much for me.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.820
Do you know how to get to Yggdrasil?

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.980
How are you planning to pass the guardians?

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.150
I'll figure it out somehow.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.700
It's fine.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.950
I've made up my mind already.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.910
Fine.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.410
Um...

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.870
Can you log in tomorrow?

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.290
Uh, sure.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.290
Then we'll meet here at 3 PM.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.380
I have to go now.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.420
Um, when you need to log out, use a room upstairs.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.300
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.470
Oh, wait!

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.390
Thanks.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.040
<i>Fine, I'll take you there then! </i>

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.220
He sure was a weird guy.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.770
Kirito-kun, huh?

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.070
We won't get to see each other until tomorrow, huh, Papa?

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.320
I'll be back real soon, Yui.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.160
Um...

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.000
Can I sleep with you

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.960
until you log out?

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.540
Y-Yeah.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.210
Go ahead.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.010
Let's rescue Asuna quickly

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.390
and buy another house somewhere.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.810
That would be a dream come true.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.980
Living together with Papa and Mama again...

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.650
It's not just a dream.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.190
I'll make it a reality soon enough.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.920
Good night, Papa.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.410
That expression is simply exquisite, Titania.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.910
Your face when you're at the brink of bursting into tears, that is.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.960
I'm tempted to capture it and put it on display.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.170
Then why don't you do just that?

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.430
You can do whatever you want here, right?

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.510
You're a system administrator, after all.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.140
I see you're as cold as always.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.480
Has there ever been a time

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.520
when I put my hands on you against your will, Titania?

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.150
Stop calling me by that weird name.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.940
I'm Asuna, Sugou-san.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.110
You're no fun.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.120
In this world, I'm the Fairy King, Oberon!

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.290
The ruler of Alfheim that all the players look up to in envy.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.870
And you are my empress, Queen Titania.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.620
Why not just play along?

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:02.880
I truly wonder when you'll willingly accept me as your companion.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.720
You're wasting your time.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.380
All I have for you is disdain and loathing.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.720
Nothing more.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.100
Honestly, you're quite strong-willed.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.560
But you know...

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.810
Lately, I've somehow

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:20.020
come to think it might be rather fun to

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.070
take you by force.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.010
Stop it...

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:54.970
I'm just joking.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.100
Remember?

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.890
I said I wouldn't be forceful.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.350
Besides, soon enough

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.610
<i>you'll</i> be the one coming after <i>me.</i>

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.900
Are you sane?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.200
Let's see how long you'll be able to keep up that attitude yours.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.450
In this world,

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:17.200
even as we speak, there are thousands of players enjoying the game.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.620
But the thing is,

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.000
they remain ignorant of the true value of the Full-Dive System—

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.670
that by stimulating the limbic system of the brain,

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.090
it might be possible to manipulate thoughts, emotions, and even memories.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.260
What...

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.850
There's no way you could get away with—

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.890
Who can stop me?

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.190
Research on the topic has already begun in multiple countries.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.900
Even so,

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.320
experimenting on humans would result in legal and ethical issues.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.280
But then one day, as I was watching the news,

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.320
I saw it.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.780
As many as ten thousand test subjects!

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.870
Kayaba-senpai was a genius, but also a real fool.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.870
He built something with such great capability,

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.500
yet was satisfied with just the
creation of a mere game world.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.300
It wasn't hard to use a router

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.300
to capture a portion of the players

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.180
as they were being freed from the game.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.510
As a result,

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.470
three hundred test subjects fell into my possession.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.480
In just two months, my research has made great progress.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.310
The technology to inject new
information into human memories

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.310
and direct the emotions related to them

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.440
is nearly complete.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.150
Quit spouting nonsense.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:34.410
Father would never allow such research!

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.160
The research is

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.620
secretly being carried out by a small team and myself.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.960
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to market it.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.960
Market?

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.260
There's an American corporation that's eagerly awaiting the research's completion.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.510
I'm going to sell it to them for a hefty sum.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.300
And RCT in its entirety eventually.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.430
I won't let that happen.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.220
The moment I return to the real world,

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.480
I'll expose all your crimes for what they are.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.690
Just so you know, you're in the same position as the other test subjects.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:11.990
If I wanted to,

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:15.410
I'd be able to alter your memories as well.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.670
I'll be right there.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.920
Wait for my orders.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:28.960
But still,

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.800
I don't want to reduce you to a mere doll.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.300
I hope that the next time we meet you'll be...

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.010
a little more docile,

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.390
Titania.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.200
Now then, farewell.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:14.380
Save me, Kirito-kun...

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:22.850
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:32.690
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.540
My endless feelings are lost
tomedonai omoi wa

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.130
in these ordinary days.
nichijou ni nomarete

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:58.300
They waver and change shape yet again.
yurameki nagara mata katachi wo kaeteitta

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.890
I wonder if I'm too late,
imasara mou osoi kana

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.350
but there's no answer in sight.
henji mo nai jimonjitou

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.350
Every decision is up to me,
subete wa sou jibun shidai

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.980
whether it's the beginning or the end.
owari mo hajimari mo

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.030
Higher and higher, I stretch out my hands.
takaku takaku kono te wo nobashite

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:27.160
Flying towards the gentle light, I flap my wings.
yasashii hikari wo mezashite habatakuyo

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.250
I embrace the passion
kokoro ni tomoshita

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.460
that flared up in my heart
jounetsu mo daite

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:42.550
and pray once more, "Someday, someday."
kitto kitto tte mou ichido negau kara
