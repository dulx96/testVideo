WEBVTT

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.580
Catch anything?

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.800
I'm sorry for startling you.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.480
My name is Nishida.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.060
I'm a fisherman here.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.020
In Japan, I worked as IT Security Director for a company called Touto High-Speed Connection.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.940
I'm Kirito.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.240
Isn't Touto High-Speed Connection...

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.660
Yes. It was in charge of this game's network security.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.830
It's a big one!

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.790
Piece of cake.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.760
Well done.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.100
Yes, but while I can catch them, cooking is another matter.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.180
I want to eat it marinated in soy sauce or as sashimi,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.810
but without the soy sauce that's...

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.440
Grilled fillets with soy sauce sound good too,

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.810
and so does simmering it with radish.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.520
Um, I know something that would work as well.
and so does simmering it with radish.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.780
Um, I know something that would work as well.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.990
What did you say?!

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.090
I recognized my cowardly past
mitometeta okubyou na kako

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.010
Remaining ignorant, I cowered in fear
wakaranai mama ni kowagateta

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:10.810
My other self reflects reality onto the present
ushiro no jibun ga genjitsu wo ima ni utsusu

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.110
This world, where I envisioned countless skies,
ikutsu mo no sora wo kaita koko wa kitto

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.370
will surely drive my frail heart insane.
hakanai kokoro midashite

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.080
In my dreams, I soared in the skies,
yume de takaku tonda karada wa

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.210
shaking off any anxieties that clung to me
donna fuan matottemo furiharatteku

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.680
A subconscious thought expands outward
nemuru chiisa na omoi hirogaridashite

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.810
Notice my weakness and stay by me
kizuku yowai watashi kimi ga ireba

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.480
so I can confidently accept this dark world
kurai sekai tsuyoku ireta

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.320
I continue to dream for all of eternity
nagai yume miru kokoro wa sou eien de

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.490
I wanna always be with you.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.490
I'll give you everything I have.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.250
My, that really hit the spot!

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.130
I never thought I'd find soy sauce in <i>this world!</i>

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.390
Oh, it's homemade.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.100
If you'd like, please take some with you later.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.430
Can I really?!

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.470
Well, I'd very much appreciate that!

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.520
That aside, your Fishing skill must be quite high.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.860
Kirito-kun has never brought back a decent catch.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.320
The lakes around here are way too hard to fish at.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.530
Well, not all of them.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.620
Only the large one that you were fishing at.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.540
Why? Is it set up like that?!

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.500
Yes, exactly.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.840
That lake...

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.470
has a king lurking in it.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.880
A king?!

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.220
Yes.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.100
Although I've hooked it several times in the past...

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.100
it was fearsomely powerful. I even lost my rods to it.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.690
So I was thinking...

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.530
I have something to ask of you.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.070
I'm up for catching the king,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.330
but is switching with a fishing rod possible?

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.580
I'm sure you'll figure it out, Kirito-kun.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.130
What will you do if you catch it?

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.090
Make it a pet?

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.170
Is that even possible?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.810
He was a cheerful old man.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.060
You invited him here unannounced, so I was surprised.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.280
In this world, there are many people just living normally,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.530
and we of the clearing group have a duty to uphold to them.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:26.580
My... greatest reason for training was my own survival, so...

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.760
I think there are a lot of people counting on you now,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.800
including me.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.100
Yeah, I <i>did promise that I would save everyone.</i>

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.070
But, at least for a little longer...

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.610
Yeah.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.250
What in the world...

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.710
Looks like everybody knew about the king.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.210
Okay, now then...

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.050
it's finally time for today's main event.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.050
Yeah, I was waiting for this!

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.720
Get it today for sure!
Yeah, I was waiting for this!

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.220
Kirito-san, I'll be counting on you.
Get it today for sure!

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.300
Nishida-san!
Kirito-san, I'll be counting on you.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.220
Kirito-san, I'll be counting on you.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.390
Okay.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.810
Just how big <i>is this thing?</i>

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.850
Here we go!

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.170
Um, didn't you hook it?

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.340
Not yet.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.550
N-Nishida-san.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.840
No, just a bit longer.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.930
Now!

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.600
I've hooked it!

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.100
Here!

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.690
S-Switch—

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.780
Fine, bring it on!

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.780
Oh, I see it!

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.040
All right, not a problem!

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.460
Wh-What's wrong?

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.630
Hey!

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.210
Ouch.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.260
Kirito-kun!

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.680
It's dangerous!

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.100
What is?!

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.610
N-N-No fair!

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.780
Don't just run away on your own!

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.990
Kirito-san!

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.410
It's walking on land.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.120
I wonder if it's a lungfish...

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.040
Kirito-san,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.580
now's not the time to be joking around like that!

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.040
Let's get out of here!

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.340
Oh, I guess you're right.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.170
I didn't want to have to do this.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.390
Miss, run away!

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.100
There's nothing to worry about.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.350
Kirito-san, your wife!

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.100
Miss!

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.410
A-Amazing!

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.540
You're Asuna-san, aren't you?

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.460
Why are you here?!

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.920
I'm your fan.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.840
Shake my hand too!

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.500
Good job.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.840
Heathcliff?

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.900
Come on, quit moping around.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.360
But it's only been two weeks...

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.360
We were called to the frontlines during our leave, so it must be something major.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.820
Well, that's true, but...

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.660
Let's at least go hear them out.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.790
Hurry, they'll be waiting.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.500
The faster we get it over with, the sooner we can come back.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.840
Yeah.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.470
Thank you for seeing us off.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.600
Although we couldn't stay long, it was fun.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.810
It was a valuable experience for me.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.640
Honestly, until I met you two,

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.940
those fighting to clear the game
seemed to be from a different world.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.450
I've been trapped in this world for two years.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.830
Even if I returned, I don't know if the company would want me.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:17.460
Deep down, I may have already given up on ever getting out of here.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.290
And so, I decided fishing here would be for the best.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.510
It's shameful to admit.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.630
That's...

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.680
That's not...

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.090
I, too...

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.810
I, too, thought the same things at first

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.560
and spent every night crying alone.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.730
With every passing day here, it felt as if my reality was gradually slipping away.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:48.200
After I cried for a while, I devoted myself to fighting.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.450
Winning and advancing.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.240
I single-mindedly aimed to become stronger.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.410
Then, I found someone taking a nap on the grass near the plaza.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.380
It really ticked me off, so I yelled at him for wasting time.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.670
And he replied, "The weather today is the nicest possible

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.090
during the nicest season in Aincrad.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.680
It'd be a waste to spend a day like this in a dungeon."

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.100
So I tried lying down for a bit and was sound asleep soon after.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.900
When I woke up, it was evening, and Kirito was grinning at me.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:30.360
But then, as we partied together, I noticed.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.740
Even in this world, he was enjoying life.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.160
I wasn't losing my days in the real world.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.920
I was just living them out here.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.380
The one who taught me that...

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.590
was Kirito-kun.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.470
When I slept with him in mind,

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.840
I stopped having bad dreams.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.470
I looked forward to seeing him.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.430
For the first time since I came here,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.350
I appreciated this world.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.100
To me, Kirito-kun is...

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.440
the meaning of the two years I spent here

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.280
and the proof that I'm alive.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.240
I put on the NerveGear that day,

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.830
so that I could meet him here.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.710
Nishida-san, I'm sure there's something here for you too.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.040
You're right.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.420
You're absolutely right.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.090
I didn't waste my life here.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.800
I really didn't.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.060
There's nothing I can do to help,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.470
but I wish you luck.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.060
Let's go fishing together again sometime.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.020
We'll be back.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.570
Teleport to Grandum!

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.380
The scouting party was wiped out?!

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.790
In preparation for the upcoming boss fight,

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.300
we sent a party of twenty players from five guilds.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:20.060
However, once the first ten reached the center of the room and the boss appeared,

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.270
the entrance door closed.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.730
So it's an Anti-Crystal Area...

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.690
And after five minutes passed, the door finally opened

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.070
and nothing was left in the room.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.200
Both the ten players and the boss had disappeared.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.490
No way...

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:44.460
Nevertheless, we cannot abandon our goal of clearing the game.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.710
Our only option is to try again
with the largest force possible.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.130
We'll offer our cooperation.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.420
However,

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.670
for me, Asuna's safety takes the highest priority.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:14:00.140
If the situation turns grave, I'll protect her instead of the party.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.560
A person who has something to protect is strong.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.730
I'll be looking forward to it.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.070
Three hours left, huh?

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.360
What should we do?

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.530
What's wrong?

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.540
Don't get angry when I say this.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.000
For today's boss raid,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.790
could you pull out and wait here for me?

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.960
Why are you saying that?

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.720
In a place where we can't use teleport crystals,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.640
it's impossible to predict what will happen.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.390
I'm scared.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.760
If anything happened to you—

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.680
So you want to go to such a dangerous place alone

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.060
while I wait here, where it's safe?

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.530
If I listen to you and you never come back,

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:57.240
I'll...

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.860
commit suicide!

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
I'd have no more reason to live,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.540
and I wouldn't be able to forgive myself for not going.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.160
Sorry...

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.210
I'm panicking.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.290
Deep down, I'd rather just run away together.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.800
I don't care if we can never return to the real world.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.550
I just want to live together with you in our home in the forest!

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.050
It'd be nice if we could.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.810
Together every day.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.310
Forever.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.480
Kirito-kun, have you ever thought about it?

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.770
About what's happening to our real bodies.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.320
After this game started and several weeks had passed,

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:46.290
there was an incident when most of the players disconnected for a few hours, remember?

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.700
During that time, all players

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.790
were likely being transported to various hospitals.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:57.920
Even if our bodies are somehow
being sustained on hospital beds,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.800
I can only imagine that their conditions have deteriorated during these years.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:07.390
So basically, regardless of whether or not the game is cleared,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:11.350
there <i>is a time limit?</i>

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:16.820
I...

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.650
I... want to always be beside you.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.870
I want to date you for real,

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.410
have a real marriage,

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.080
and grow old together!

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.540
So...

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.750
So...

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.260
For now, all we can do is fight, right?

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.610
Hey!

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.370
Oh, you guys are coming too?

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.990
Why the surprise?

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.330
I'm abandoning my store to lend a hand here.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.460
I can't believe you failed to recognize my self-sacrificing spirit.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.340
Then I guess you won't need a cut of the item drops.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.840
No, that would be...

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.780
Open Corridor.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.070
Now, let us go.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.290
It's sort of unsettling, isn't it?

00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.750
Yeah.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.260
Is everyone ready?

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:17.940
Broadly speaking, the Knights of the Blood will stay up front and keep boss in check,

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:23.190
so in the meantime, discern its attack
patterns and counterattack as appropriate.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:29.950
It'll likely be a difficult battle, but I believe that your strength will allow us to pull through.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.910
For our freedom!

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.510
It'll be fine.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.840
Kirito-kun, I'll protect you.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.220
So you protect me too, okay?

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.560
Yeah. You can count on it.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.110
Don't die.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.070
Right back at you!

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.610
I'm going to make a killing off today's drops,

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.280
so I don't intend to die.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.660
Attack!

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.560
Nothing's happening...

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.740
Above us!

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.040
The Skull...

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.500
Reaper?

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.290
Don't panic!

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.790
Distance yourselves!

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.670
This way!

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:07.920
Run!

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.560
I-In one hit?

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.020
That's insane...

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.920
We can't even approach it!

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.130
Get back!

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.010
<i>I can't repel it...</i>

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.440
If we intercept it together, we can stop it.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.560
It's no problem for us!

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.520
All right.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.570
We'll take care of the scythes!

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.820
Everyone else, attack its flanks!

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.280
Here we go!

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.030
Okay...

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.910
Quit thrashing around!

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.090
Damn it!

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.680
Kirito-kun!

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.560
Yeah.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:39.610
The far-sounding chime of a bell carried a solitary tone
tooku ni kikoeta kane no ne ga sukoshi samishikute

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:51.420
It rang once more, but with greater clarity and vibrance
mou ichido tsuyoku kondo wa takaku kakenuketa

00:22:51.420 --> 00:23:03.220
Neither this ever-repeating reality nor these wishes that dot the sky
tada kurikaesu genjitsu mo hoshi no kazu no negaigoto mo

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:13.820
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
mezasu beki asu wo mitsuketa kono omoi ni wa katenai

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:24.870
It's fine if the boundless world spread before me is merely a dream
me no mae ni hirakareta hatenai sekai tatoe yume demo ii

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:37.460
Even if it continues to waver, it always clearly resounds in my dreams
mayoi tsuzuketemo yume no oku de tsuyoku zutto zutto hibiiteku

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:44.260
Softly, softly shining
sotto sotto hikatteru
